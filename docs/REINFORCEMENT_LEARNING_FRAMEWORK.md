# AegisIDE Reinforcement Learning Framework

## Overview

AegisIDE implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) system** where the LLM agent learns from experience through a reward/punishment mechanism, storing learned patterns in the Memory Bank for continuous self-improvement.

---

## Core RL Principles

### 1. State-Action-Reward Loop

```
State (Current Context) → Action (LLM Decision) → Reward/Punishment → Learning Update → Memory Bank
```

**Flow**:
1. LLM observes current state from Memory Bank
2. Takes action (code edit, file creation, workflow execution)
3. Receives immediate reward or punishment based on outcome
4. Updates knowledge in `mistakes.json` and `memory.json`
5. Future decisions influenced by accumulated learning

---

## Reward System

### Positive Rewards (+Points)

| Action | Reward | Stored In | Trigger |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Constitutional Compliance** | +50 | `progress.json` | Following File Modification Protocol |
| **Successful Validation** | +30 | `systemPatterns.json` | Zero errors/warnings on first try |
| **Autonomous Recovery** | +40 | `mistakes.json` → resolved: true | Fixing error without human intervention |
| **Pattern Reuse** | +20 | `memory.json` | Applying learned pattern correctly |
| **Zero-Duplication** | +25 | `systemPatterns.json` | Successfully updating existing file |
| **EMD Compliance** | +15 | `progress.json` | File ≤80 lines, proper decomposition |
| **MCP Integration** | +10 | `activeContext.json` | Complete MCP chain execution |
| **Consensus Achievement** | +35 | `kanban.json` | ≥95% parliamentary consensus |

### Negative Penalties (-Points)

| Violation | Penalty | Stored In | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **File Creation Violation** | -10 | `mistakes.json` | Creating duplicate file |
| **Constitutional Breach** | -50 | `mistakes.json` | Violating governance rules |
| **Validation Failure** | -20 | `mistakes.json` | Errors/warnings in code |
| **MCP Omission** | -15 | `activeContext.json` | Missing mandatory MCP call |
| **Unused Variables** | -5 | `mistakes.json` | ZUV violation |
| **EMD Violation** | -10 | `mistakes.json` | File >80 lines |
| **Permission Request** | -25 | `scratchpad.json` | Asking for permission in 0-99% autonomy |
| **Duplicate Logic** | -15 | `mistakes.json` | Not reusing existing patterns |
| **Consensus Failure** | -30 | `kanban.json` | <95% consensus on major decision |

## Learning Mechanism

### 1. Immediate Feedback (mistakes.json)

```json
{
  "error_patterns": [
    {
      "id": "file_creation_violation_naukri_test",
      "category": "constitutional_violation",
      "penalty": "Reinforcement learning: -10 reward",
      "learning": "Before ANY file creation: 1) Search existing, 2) Update if found, 3) Create only if justified",
      "occurred_at": "2025-10-13T12:23:00+05:30",
      "resolved": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Learning Process**:
- **Violation occurs** → Penalty logged
- **Pattern extracted** → Prevention rule created
- **Future similar context** → LLM recalls penalty → Avoids mistake
- **Successful correction** → Reward logged → Pattern reinforced

### 2. Pattern Recognition (memory.json)

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "file_modification_protocol",
      "entityType": "constitutional_rule",
      "observations": [
        "Penalty -10: Created test_naukri_unified_20.py when test_naukri_20_validation.py existed",
        "Reward +25: Successfully updated test_naukri_20_validation.py instead of creating new file",
        "Learning: Pattern 'test_*_validation.py' → always check existing first"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Success Tracking (systemPatterns.json)

```json
{
  "successful_patterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "pre_file_creation_check",
      "description": "Always run find_by_name before write_to_file",
      "success_count": 15,
      "reward_accumulated": +375,
      "last_applied": "2025-10-13T12:24:00+05:30"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Self-Learning Workflow

### Phase 1: Experience Collection
```
Action → Outcome → Reward/Penalty → Log to mistakes.json
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Extraction
```
mistakes.json → Identify recurring patterns → Create prevention rules
```

### Phase 3: Knowledge Integration
```
Prevention rules → memory.json entities → Future decision guidance
```

### Phase 4: Behavioral Adaptation
```
Similar context detected → Recall penalty/reward → Adjust behavior → Avoid mistakes
```

---

## Cumulative Learning Score

### Score Calculation

```python
total_score = sum(rewards) - sum(penalties)
learning_efficiency = (successful_actions / total_actions) * 100
autonomy_level = min(99.5, base_autonomy + (total_score / 100))
```

**Stored in**: `progress.json`

```json
{
  "reinforcement_learning": {
    "total_score": +285,
    "rewards_earned": +450,
    "penalties_incurred": -165,
    "learning_efficiency": 73.2,
    "autonomy_adjustment": +2.85,
    "last_updated": "2025-10-13T12:27:00+05:30"
  }
}
```

## Meta-Learning: Learning to Learn

### Level 1: Mistake Avoidance
- Recall specific penalties
- Avoid exact same mistake
- **Example**: Don't create `test_naukri_unified_20.py` again

### Level 2: Pattern Generalization
- Extract broader rules from specific cases
- Apply to similar contexts
- **Example**: Check ALL `test_*` files before creation, not just Naukri

### Level 3: Predictive Learning
- Anticipate violations before they occur
- Proactive compliance checking
- **Example**: Auto-scan for existing files before ANY file creation

### Level 4: Strategic Optimization
- Optimize for maximum rewards
- Chain high-reward actions
- **Example**: Prioritize constitutional compliance (+50) over quick fixes

---

## Integration with Constitutional Framework

### Article I: Governance
- **Reward**: +35 for achieving ≥95% consensus
- **Penalty**: -30 for bypassing parliamentary review

### Article II: Decision Making
- **Reward**: +50 for constitutional compliance ≥80%
- **Penalty**: -50 for constitutional breach

### Article III: Memory Bank
- **Reward**: +10 per MCP integration
- **Penalty**: -15 for MCP omission

### Article IV: Quality
- **Reward**: +30 for zero-tolerance validation pass
- **Penalty**: -20 for validation failure

### Article VII: Autonomous Operations

## Practical Example: File Creation Violation

### Scenario
LLM attempts to create `test_naukri_unified_20.py` when `test_naukri_20_validation.py` already exists.

### RL Process

**Step 1: Violation Detected**
```json
{
  "action": "write_to_file(test_naukri_unified_20.py)",
  "outcome": "VIOLATION - duplicate file",
  "penalty": -10
}
```

**Step 2: Learning Recorded**
```json
{
  "id": "file_creation_violation_naukri_test",
  "learning": "Before ANY file creation: 1) Search existing, 2) Update if found",
  "penalty": -10
}
```

**Step 3: Correction Applied**
```json
{
  "action": "replace_file_content(test_naukri_20_validation.py)",
  "outcome": "SUCCESS - updated existing file",
  "reward": +25
}
```

**Step 4: Pattern Generalized**
```json
{
  "pattern": "test_*_validation.py → always update existing",
  "success_count": 1,
  "reward_accumulated": +25
}
```

**Step 5: Future Behavior**
- Next time similar context detected
- LLM automatically checks existing files first
- Avoids penalty, earns reward
- **Net improvement**: +35 points (+25 reward - -10 avoided penalty)
