# AegisIDE Development Roadmap
**Current Version**: 2.8.8  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready & Growing

## What Makes AegisIDE Special

### Intelligent AI That Never Forgets
Unlike other AI coding assistants that start fresh every conversation, AegisIDE creates a persistent "brain" for your project that remembers:
- What you're building and why
- Coding standards and architectural decisions  
- Past mistakes and how to avoid them
- Project progress and next priorities

### Democratic Quality Control
AegisIDE uses a unique "tri-branch government" system to ensure quality:
- **Executive Branch**: Implements your features
- **Legislative Branch**: Reviews code quality and standards
- **Judicial Branch**: Enforces best practices and prevents errors

This prevents the common AI problems of inconsistent code, forgotten context, and repeated mistakes.

### 98% Autonomous Operation
Most AI assistants require constant guidance. AegisIDE works independently:
- Reads your project requirements automatically
- Plans and executes tasks without constant prompting
- Validates code quality before moving to next task
- Updates project documentation and progress tracking
