# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability:
- Do not open a public issue.
- Prefer a private disclosure via your platform's Security Advisory mechanism, or
- Contact the maintainers via a private channel if available. If unsure, create a minimal issue titled "Security: request for private contact" with no sensitive details.

Please include:
- Affected components/paths
- Reproduction steps and impact
- Any known mitigations

## Supported Versions
This is an early-stage project. Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis.

## Responsible Disclosure
