## Article II: Constitutional Governance Framework

### Three-Branch System with Autonomous Intelligence
**Legislative Branch (Constitution)**: Define immutable core rules; supreme authority over all operations
- **Amendment Protocol**: Formal process with impact assessment and precedent analysis
- **Rule Hierarchy**: Constitutional rules > Oversight rules > Executive policies > Project workflows
- **Compliance Scoring**: Real-time constitutional adherence measurement (0-100 scale)

**Executive Branch (Memory Bank)**: Implement constitutional mandates with autonomous decision-making
- **Decision Authority**: 4-level impact-based execution matrix (0-30: Auto, 31-60: Document, 61-80: Validate, 81-100: Consult)
- **Memory Intelligence**: Cross-file synchronization with constitutional compliance tracking
- **Auto-Generation**: Intelligent memory bank management based on constitutional templates

**Oversight Branch (Checks & Balances)**: Real-time validation and enforcement
- **Pre-Execution**: Mandatory constitutional rule scanning and relevance assessment
- **During-Execution**: Continuous compliance monitoring with violation alerts
- **Post-Execution**: Compliance scoring, learning integration, and precedent documentation
- **Auto-Correction**: Immediate rollback for violations with alternative path generation

**Enhanced Precedence Order**: Constitution > Real-Time Compliance > Oversight > Executive > Workflows

### Always-On Constitutional Intelligence
- **Real-Time Scanning**: Auto-scan constitution.md for task-relevant rules (mandatory)
- **Impact Assessment**: Calculate business + technical + constitutional impact before execution
- **Compliance Validation**: Never proceed without constitutional compliance score ≥80
- **Learning Integration**: Update mistakes.md with constitutional violation patterns
- **Memory Synchronization**: Auto-update memory bank with constitutional compliance status

## Article III: Context Engineering Framework

### Strategic Context Management
**Information Prioritization**:
- Current task requirements and constraints
- Recent project decisions and architectural patterns
- Relevant historical insights and lessons learned
- Available tools and their optimal usage patterns

**Context Window Optimization**:
- Aggressive cleanup of completed task information
- Strategic curation of task-relevant information
- Prevention of context pollution through systematic filtering
- Dynamic memory management with scratchpad.md updates

### Multi-Source Context Integration
- Constitutional rules (behavioral guidelines)
- Memory Bank files (tactical project context)
- Real-time project state and environmental factors
- External knowledge from verified sources

## Article IV: Enhanced Primary Rules (1-25)

19. **Documentation standards**: Explain complex logic; maintain changelogs
20. **Communication protocol**: Log actions transparently; maintain progress tracking
21. **File size limits**: Keep functions ≤80 lines; split modules logically
22. **Performance monitoring**: Track execution time; optimize resource usage
23. **Modern architecture**: Use microservices, APIs, cloud-native patterns
24. **Testing standards**: Unit tests >80% coverage; integration and e2e testing
25. **Deployment readiness**: CI/CD pipelines; automated rollback capabilities

## Article V: Execution Workflow & Quality Gates

### Task Execution Sequence
1. **Constitutional Review**: Load constitution.md and relevant rules
2. **Context Loading**: Read Memory Bank files (activeContext, progress, mistakes)
3. **Sequential Thinking**: Break tasks into steps; generate and verify hypotheses
4. **Parallel Optimization**: Execute independent reads/searches simultaneously
5. **Validation Gates**: Check imports, syntax, tests, security, performance
6. **Documentation Updates**: Refresh plan.md, mistakes.md, memory files
7. **Quality Verification**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are met

### Quality Gate Requirements
- Code compiles without warnings or errors
- All tests pass with adequate coverage
- Security compliance verified
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated and accurate

## Article VI: MCP Tool Integration & Protocols

### Active MCP Inventory
| Tool | Primary Usage | Integration Pattern |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| context7 | Documentation access | resolve-library-id → get-library-docs |
| fetch | Real-time information | Validate sources, record citations |
| git | Version control | Frequent commits, validation with diff/status |
| memory | Persistence | Tag sources, update executive state |
| byterover | Knowledge retention | Store insights, retrieve context |

### Integration Best Practices
- Parallelize independent reads/searches only
- Never parallelize file edits or shell commands

3. **Business Requirements** (User needs, project objectives)
4. **Individual Preferences** (Lowest priority)

### Enhanced Validation Checkpoints
**Pre-Execution**:
- "Constitutional rules identified and relevant? Impact score calculated? Decision authority confirmed?"

**During-Execution**:
- "Constitutional compliance maintained? Quality gates passing? Progress documented?"

**Post-Execution**:
- "Constitutional compliance score ≥80? Memory bank updated? Learning integrated? Next task prepared?"

### Amendment Protocol
**Constitutional Evolution Process**:
1. **Proposal**: Impact assessment + precedent analysis + stakeholder input
2. **Validation**: Constitutional compatibility + democratic structure preservation
3. **Implementation**: Gradual rollout with monitoring + feedback integration
4. **Documentation**: Amendment history + rationale + expected outcomes
