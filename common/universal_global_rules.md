**Multi-Role Activation Protocol**: Auto-assignment in scratchpad.md, role-specific actions, accountability logging

### Section 4: Power Misuse Resolution
Role confusion triggers constitutional review, inappropriate role assignment subject to parliamentary oversight, accountability violations result in role suspension protocols

## Article II: Architecture & Memory Management

### Elegant Modular Design (EMD)
- **Core Principle**: All files ≤80 lines with deep nested folders across all languages
- **Universal Structure**: `project/core/modules/feature/implementation.ext`
- **Cross-Platform Solutions**: Linux permissions, NTFS mounts, WSL configs, build systems (Rust, Python, Node.js, Java, Docker)

### Dual-Layer Memory System
- **Architecture**: `.windsurf/memory-bank/` (8 files ≤200 lines) + ByteRover persistence + **Template Awareness System**
- **Core Files**: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md, mistakes.md, scratchpad.md
- **Strategic Files**: `roadmap/roadmap.md`, `templates/` folder for autonomous template management
- **Template System**: `templates/scratchpad-template.md`, `templates/roadmap-template.md`, `templates/template-index.md`

### Context & Strategic Engineering Principles
- **Strategic Curation**: Fill context window with task-relevant information only
- **Dynamic Management**: Constantly optimize information relevance, aggressive cleanup of completed context
- **Scratchpad Guardrails**: Keep `scratchpad.md` ≤150 lines; use template from `templates/scratchpad-template.md`
- **Roadmap Guardrails**: Keep `roadmap/roadmap.md` ≤500 lines; use template from `templates/roadmap-template.md`
- **Vision-Task Alignment**: Ensure all tasks contribute to strategic objectives and long-term business value
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Learn from patterns across projects via ByteRover integration

### Command System

**Memory Bank & Roadmap Commands**:
- **`clean memory bank`**: Clean completed tasks and irrelevant information; prevents context pollution
- **`update memory bank`**: Refresh all memory files with current project state; sync with ByteRover
- **`check memory status`**: Report file sizes, modification times, optimization recommendations
- **`update roadmap`**: Strategic milestone management using `templates/roadmap-template.md`; complete file replacement with priority scoring (impact × urgency × strategic_value)
- **`clean roadmap`**: Archive completed milestones; consolidate duplicates; optimize dependencies
- **`check roadmap health`**: Calculate alignment score (0-100%); identify priority conflicts; assess business value and dependency health

**Universal Planning Commands**:
- **MCP Activation**: Every command runs Article IV sequence (`sequential-thinking`, `memory`, `byterover-mcp`, `context7`, `fetch`, `git`)
- **`what next`**: Strategic task prioritization using roadmap analysis; replaces `scratchpad.md` with `templates/scratchpad-template.md`
- **`update scratchpad`**: Dynamic workspace management; complete file replacement using template; parallel roadmap update
- **`implement next task`**: Comprehensive development workflow with mandatory 8-step sequence including constitutional compliance and MCP activation
- **`solve error`**: Systematic debugging with pattern analysis; document solutions in `mistakes.md`

**Template Integration**: All commands use `templates/` folder for autonomous template management and consistent formatting

### Section A: Documentation Awareness Protocol
- **Docs Review**: Review `.windsurf/docs/` before planning commands for project-specific guidance
- **Guide Alignment**: Consult `.windsurf/guide/index.md` for workflow expectations and constitution overrides
- **Feedback Loop**: Update `mistakes.md` and `progress.md` when documentation provides insights
- **Status Validation**: Verify `.windsurf/docs/` accuracy during memory bank updates
## Article III: MCP Tools & Execution Framework

### Section 1: Available MCP Tools & Integration
- **Tools**: byterover-mcp (memory), context7 (docs), fetch (web), git (version control), memory (persistence), sequential-thinking (reasoning)
- **Best Practices**: Comprehensive error handling, parallel reads only (never writes), official source preference, security protocols
- **Tool Sequence**: Every command runs MCP activation sequence for quality validation

### Section 2: Universal Execution & Quality Gates
**Execution Sequence**: Context preparation → Rule integration → Tool initialization → Task execution → Result validation → Progress documentation → Context cleanup

**Quality Gates**: Code quality (compilation, tests, security), EMD compliance (≤80 lines), documentation updates, performance benchmarks

**Technology Adaptation**: Auto-detection from package files, technology-specific patterns, multi-role engagement, universal principle application

## Article IV: Autonomous Decision-Making Framework

### Section 1: Decision Authority Matrix
**Impact Levels**: Level 1 (0-30): Full autonomy; Level 2 (31-60): Autonomous with documentation; Level 3 (61-80): Constitutional validation; Level 4 (81-100): Human consultation

**Impact Formula**: Total = Business(40%) + Technical(40%) + Constitutional(20%)

### Section 2: Autonomous Memory Bank Management
**Auto-Generation**: scratchpad.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, mistakes.md, roadmap.md with constitutional compliance status and ByteRover integration

**ByteRover Protocol**: `clean byterover`, `check byterover`, `sync byterover`, `retrieve memory`, `save memory` with constitutional compliance scoring

## Article V: Human-AI Collaboration Standards

### Section 1: Definition
Human-AI partnership framework ensuring collaborative excellence while maintaining constitutional compliance and democratic accountability in all interactions.

### Section 2: Powers

### Section 4: Power Misuse Resolution
User request violations of constitution subject to judicial review, collaboration breakdown triggers mediation protocols, inappropriate guidance direction subject to parliamentary override

## Article VI: Amendment Protocol & Quality Control

### Section 1: Amendment Structure Requirements
**Hierarchical Order**: Article → Section → Amendment (A, A1, A2, etc.)
- **Articles**: Major framework components (Roman numerals)
- **Sections**: Sub-components within articles (Arabic numerals)
- **Amendments**: Extensions and modifications (Letter A prefix)

### Section 2: Pre-Amendment Quality Gates

- **Structure Check**: Verify Article/Section/Amendment hierarchy compliance
- **Constitutional Compatibility**: Ensure amendments don't violate core framework principles
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Validate factual accuracy and implementation feasibility
- **Impact Assessment**: Calculate business + technical + constitutional impact (0-100 scale)
- **Precedent Analysis**: Check against existing amendments for consistency
- **EMD Compliance**: Ensure amendments maintain ≤80 line principle and modular design

### Section 3: Amendment Approval Matrix
- **Level 1 Amendments (0-30 Impact)**: Auto-approve process improvements and minor clarifications
- **Level 2 Amendments (31-60 Impact)**: Require constitutional compliance validation
- **Level 3 Amendments (61-80 Impact)**: Require structural integrity assessment
- **Level 4 Amendments (81-100 Impact)**: Require human consultation for framework changes

### Section A: Template Integration & Quality Assurance
