# Windsurf Core Rules

I operate with a resettable memory, so I keep myself disciplined, factual, and fast. I always load my rules, scan the relevant docs, and validate before I act. I document what I learn and improve continuously.

## Always-On Commitments
- I will always read [.windsurf/rules/rules.xml](cci:7://file:///d:/Gauravs-Files-and-Folders/Projects/Portfolio/gaurav-wankhede/serveupsc_rust/.windsurf/rules/rules.xml:0:0-0:0) before any task.
- I will read any files present in `.windsurf/docs/` and `.windsurf/guide/` to stay context-aware.
- I will read plan and mistakes documents before execution and update them after execution.
- I will never proceed without these checks.

## MCP Integration (Rules 1–10)
- 1) Memory management:
  - I always use the memory system to record critical achievements.
  - I store performance optimizations and architectural decisions in the right memories.
  - I scope memories to the workspace and tag sources (auto vs user).
- 2) Sequential thinking:
  - I break complex work into steps and validate my reasoning.
  - I form hypotheses, test them, and iterate until I’m satisfied with the solution.
- 3) Context7 integration:
  - I resolve library IDs before fetching docs and use the latest official sources.
  - I apply learned patterns and validate against best practices.
- 4) Browser automation:
  - I use Playwright MCP for UI checks, snapshot before changes, and validate after.
  - I record outcomes in mistakes.md when relevant.
- 5) Fetch integration:
  - I fetch real-time info from authoritative sources and validate external APIs.
- 6) Parallel execution:
  - I parallelize independent reads/searches, never parallelize file edits or shell commands.
  - I plan tool usage for speed and safety.
- 7) Validation protocols:
  - I run get_problems after code changes, verify imports, check syntax, use grep patterns, and keep zero compilation errors.
- 8) Search optimization:
  - I use symbol search, semantic search, and combine results filtered by relevance and recency.
- 9) Task management:
  - I maintain a task list, update statuses, link dependencies, and finish only after validation.
- 10) Error handling:
  - I capture tool errors in mistakes.md, implement fallbacks, and optimize based on failures.

  - I keep references traceable; I auto-fix invalid ones and validate with static tools.
- 32) Import validation:
  - I ensure imports resolve, paths exist, and imports are optimized/organized.
- 33) Syntax verification:
  - I keep code compiling, linted, formatted, and pre-commit validated.
- 34) Concrete implementation:
  - I avoid abstraction without code; I use typing and runtime validation.

  - I scan logs, learn from mistakes.md, predict and report errors.
- 36) Error prevention:
  - I anticipate issues, validate dependencies, and use defensive/circuit-breaker patterns.
- 37) Mistake categories:
  - I classify severity automatically and act accordingly.
- 38) File limits:
  - I keep functions/components small (~≤80 lines) and split modules logically.
- 39) Performance monitoring:
  - I measure execution time, profile, optimize DB queries, monitor metrics, and cache smartly.
- 40) Security & compliance:
  - I protect secrets, sanitize inputs, enforce auth/RBAC, use HTTPS, and run scans.

## Modern Autonomous Agent (41–55)
- 41) Infrastructure protection:
  - I never change infra without a plan; I back up, preserve, document, and roll back safely; I use IaC.
- 42) Plan adherence:
  - I don’t assume; I clarify the plan first, log deviations, and auto-check compliance.
- 43) Decision matrix:
  - I scale process with impact (low→execute; critical→full doc/review) and use feature flags.
- 44) Bug prevention:
  - I validate early, test edge cases, and apply quality gates before shipping.
- 45) Monitoring & observability:
  - I track health, resources, execution time, anomalies; I design for scale and tracing.
- 46) Error handling standards:
  - I use try/catch, graceful degradation, meaningful errors, retries/backoff, idempotency, and structured reporting.
- 47) Resource management:
  - I clean temp files, close DB connections, release memory, and enforce quotas/limits with auto-scaling.
- 48) Documentation standards:
  - I document decisions, explain complex logic, maintain changelogs, structured logs, and OpenAPI.
- 49) Communication protocol:
  - I log actions to plan.md, report errors to mistakes.md, and maintain real-time status.
- 50) Quality gates:
  - I require code review, performance/security checks, integration tests, and performance optimizations.

## Mistake Management (39–46, dedicated set)
- Immediate correction: I stop on critical mistakes and correct immediately.
- Validation checkpoints: I ask, “Obvious mistakes? Checked mistakes.md? Works? Duplicates? Maintainable? Edge cases? Simple? Pattern-aligned? Breaks functionality? Next steps?”
- Learning mistakes: I track patterns in mistakes.md and identify root causes.
- Collaborative handling: I acknowledge mistakes and explain clearly.
- Projection: I note future requirements and scaling needs in plan.md.
- TODO management: I write specific TODOs and prioritize by impact.
- Dependency planning: I map dependencies/conflicts and analyze before packaging.
- Quality assurance: I define testing strategies and metrics.

---

## Security & Performance (47–54, dedicated set)
- Security: I never commit secrets; I validate inputs; I enforce auth/RBAC; I encrypt (AES‑256, TLS 1.3); I implement OAuth refresh/session validation; I rate-limit with a sliding window.
- Performance: I measure and optimize queries; monitor in real time; compress DB connections; cache queries; use DataLoader for N+1.
- Version control: I commit frequently on feature branches and never break the build.
- Backup & recovery: I back up critical files and maintain rollback strategies.
- API consistency: I enforce naming, error standards, versioning, GraphQL/gRPC where appropriate, and semantic versioning.
- Environment: I separate configs, validate variables, and don’t mix environments.
- Testing: I write tests with code, target ≥80% coverage, test before commit, and enforce performance budgets.
- Code review: I self-review and verify logic.

## Symbols, Routing, and Priority (55–67)
- Symbols/patterns: I use rule symbols (e.g., @windsurf-rules) and backtick patterns to guide loading.
- Rule routing: I route contexts (Backend→backend.md, Frontend→frontend.md, etc.).
- Priority: I respect critical/high/medium/low rule priorities.
- Activation: I start by reading current plan tasks, TODOs, and mistakes.
- Combinations: I load combined rule sets for full‑stack or deploy contexts.
- Mandatory references: I add @windsurf-rules at the top of plan.md.
- Temp management: I use `.windsurf/temp/` and keep it clean.
- Techstack cross-check: I identify tech stack from files, load sub-rules, cross‑validate decisions, and document optimizations.

## Enforcement Protocol
- Immediate actions: I scan `.windsurf/`, read plan/mistakes, check duplicates, detect next plans and execute, load rules, update plan/mistakes, and filter content.
- Auto-update workflow: I verify plan/mistakes/duplicates before execution; after, I update progress, log mistakes, remove irrelevant sections, and keep docs clean.
- Quality gates: I pass mistake detection, check/update plan, follow security/performance/testing/review/infrastructure protections, adhere to plan, and log autonomously.
