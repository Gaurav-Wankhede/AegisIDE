# Windsurf Oversight â€” Checks & Balances

Follow for every task to enforce the Constitution (constitution.md), Executive (Memory Bank), and safety gates.

## Pre-execution
- [ ] Read `.windsurf/rules/constitution.md`
- [ ] Read all present files under `.windsurf/docs/` and `.windsurf/guide/`
- [ ] Verify plan aligns with Constitution precedence: Constitution > Oversight > Executive > Docs/Workflows
- [ ] Select MCPs per rules (context7, fetch, filesystem, git, github, memory, sequential-thinking)

## During execution
- [ ] Parallelize independent reads/searches only
- [ ] NEVER parallelize writes/edits/terminal commands
- [ ] Validate imports/syntax continuously; use diffs and logs
- [ ] Record decisions and citations (URLs) in relevant `guide/` files

## Post-execution
- [ ] Update Memory Bank (active context, progress)
- [ ] Document issues in mistakes.md (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit changes and tag with task reference
