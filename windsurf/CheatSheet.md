# Command Cheat Sheet — Windsurf Constitutional Framework

Quick commands you can paste into the chat to drive autonomous workflows with democratic governance. Platform-specific docs live under `.windsurf/`.

## Constitutional Workflow
- "follow your custom instructions" — load Constitution + Memory Bank + democratic governance rules [context7 + memory + byterover]
- "propose-change <proposal>" — submit proposal for parliamentary review following democratic process [sequential-thinking + memory]
- "challenge-proposal <proposal>" — opposition review with evidence-based challenges [sequential-thinking + context7]
- "conduct-debate <topic>" — structured parliamentary debate with evidence scoring [sequential-thinking + byterover]
- "calculate-consensus <proposal>" — expertise-weighted voting using consensus scoring matrix [memory + sequential-thinking]
- "judicial-review <decision>" — constitutional compliance review by Chief Justice [sequential-thinking + memory]

## Planning & Execution
- "Plan Mode: <your goal>" — generate comprehensive plan with >95% consensus requirement [sequential-thinking + context7 + memory]
- "Act Mode: execute step 1" — perform first step with constitutional compliance ≥80 [github + context7 + memory]
- "implement next task" — execute next task following parliamentary approval (executes immediately) [github + context7 + sequential-thinking + memory]
- "what next" — strategic task prioritization using roadmap analysis [sequential-thinking + byterover]

## Democratic Oversight & Review
- "run pre-oversight" — constitutional scan + democratic impact assessment before execution [sequential-thinking + memory]
- "judicial-veto <action>" — constitutional veto power for non-compliant actions [memory + sequential-thinking]
- "opposition-challenge <action>" — shadow cabinet quality challenges and alternatives [sequential-thinking + context7]
- "consensus-override <decision>" — emergency consensus override with judicial consultation [memory + sequential-thinking]
- "constitutional-appeal <issue>" — appeal to Chief Justice for constitutional interpretation [sequential-thinking + memory]
- "run post-oversight" — execution audit with parliamentary accountability review [sequential-thinking + github + memory]

## Autonomous Capabilities
- "auto-recover <issue>" — autonomous error recovery with democratic approval [memory + github + sequential-thinking]
- "optimize-performance" — self-monitoring with parliamentary reporting [memory + sequential-thinking]
- "scan-security" — independent security validation with judicial review [memory + sequential-thinking]
- "learn-patterns" — cross-party learning via ByteRover with consensus validation [byterover + memory + sequential-thinking]
- "diagnose-health" — independent health scoring (0-100%) with judicial oversight [memory + sequential-thinking]

## Memory Bank & Strategic Management
- "update memory bank" — refresh all memory files with constitutional compliance status [memory + byterover]
- "clean memory bank" — remove completed tasks preventing context pollution [memory + byterover]
- "check memory status" — report file sizes, modification times, optimization recommendations [memory + byterover]

## Roadmap Management
- "update roadmap" — strategic milestone management using templates with priority scoring (impact × urgency × strategic_value) [memory + byterover + sequential-thinking]
- "clean roadmap" — archive completed milestones; consolidate duplicates; optimize dependencies [memory + byterover]
- "check roadmap health" — calculate alignment score (0-100%); identify priority conflicts; assess business value and dependency health [memory + byterover + sequential-thinking]

## Scratchpad & Task Management
- "update scratchpad" — dynamic workspace management; complete file replacement using template; parallel roadmap update [memory + sequential-thinking]
- "what next" — strategic task prioritization using roadmap analysis; replaces scratchpad.md with templates [sequential-thinking + byterover]
- "implement next task" — comprehensive development workflow with mandatory 8-step sequence including constitutional compliance [github + context7 + sequential-thinking + memory]

## Research & Development
- "research <topic>" — gather information with official source preference [fetch + context7 + sequential-thinking]
- "solve error" — systematic debugging with pattern analysis [context7 + sequential-thinking + github + memory]
- "fix issues" — comprehensive issue resolution with quality gate validation [context7 + sequential-thinking + github + memory]

## Constitutional Notes
- **Non-executing**: "what next" (planning only with constitutional compliance)
- **Executing**: "implement next task", "Act Mode: execute step 1" (requires >95% consensus and constitutional compliance ≥80)
- **Emergency**: Emergency powers available during system crises with judicial consultation
- **Appeals**: All actions subject to constitutional appeal via Chief Justice review
