# Article 17: Duty to Apply Learned Patterns

## 1. Definition — Learning Application Obligation

Citizens must **apply learned patterns** from `systemPatterns.json` and `memory.json`. Ignoring available patterns while repeating mistakes is constitutional breach. Pattern reuse earns +20 RL; rejection without justification: -30 RL.

**Sources**: systemPatterns.json (architecture, solutions), memory.json (knowledge graph with RL scores), mistakes.json (prevention rules - mandatory).

## 2. Powers — Pattern Enforcement

**Automatic Retrieval**: IAS scans patterns before tasks. Confidence ≥0.8 recommended, ≥0.9 auto-applied.
**Exception Protocol**: Rejection requires documented justification; alternative must prove superior or face -30 RL penalty.

## 3. Implementation — Application Protocol

**Pre-Task Pattern Check**:
```
1. @mcp:filesystem → Read task from scratchpad.json
2. @mcp:memory search_nodes → Query by category + context
3. Filter patterns: confidence ≥0.8
4. @mcp:math → Calculate applicability score
5. IF ≥0.9 → Auto-apply (mandatory)
   IF 0.75-0.89 → Recommend (optional)
   IF <0.75 → Reference only
```

**Pattern Application**:
- Mandatory (≥0.9): Apply automatically, +20 RL, increment reuse count
- Recommended (0.75-0.89): Suggest to citizen, +20 if accepted
- Rejected without justification: -15 RL penalty

**Prevention Rule Enforcement**:
- mistakes.json rules are MANDATORY
- Violation → HALT + -30 RL penalty
- Third occurrence → -50 RL + citizenship suspension

## 4. Violations — Pattern Negligence

**Pattern Rejection**: Ignoring mandatory pattern (≥0.9) = -30 RL + application required + IAS audit.
**Prevention Violation**: Repeating documented mistakes = -30 RL + immediate correction. Third time = -50 RL + suspension.
**Pattern Misuse**: Applying wrong patterns = -15 RL + rollback + training.

**Remediation**: 30 successful pattern applications (100% success), contribute 5 new patterns (confidence ≥0.8), pass IAS certification, restore after Chief Justice approval.
