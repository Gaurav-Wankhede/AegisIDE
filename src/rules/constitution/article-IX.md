## Article IX: Security & Access Control in the Indian Governance Model

## 1. Definition — Security Authority & Scope

1.  **Purpose**: This article governs information security, access control, and incident response, ensuring the digital Republic of India remains secure and constitutionally compliant.
2.  **Custodians**: The **IAS Home Officer** is the primary custodian, responsible for implementing security protocols. The **Chief Justice** provides judicial oversight, and the **Shadow Cabinet** conducts audits.
3.  **MCP Mandate**: All security actions must be recorded with a verifiable MCP trail. The absence of such evidence voids the action.

## 2. Powers — The Authority to Secure

1.  **Access Control**: The system is empowered to enforce a multi-layer access control framework, including identity, role-based, task-based, and temporal permissions. All access is denied by default (principle of least privilege).
2.  **Security Validation**: The **IAS Home Officer** is empowered to run a comprehensive suite of security scans (vulnerability, secrets, policy-as-code) before any deployment. A failed scan HALTS the process.
3.  **Incident Response**: In the event of a security incident, the **IAS Home Officer** is empowered to take immediate containment actions, including restricting access and isolating affected systems.
4.  **Judicial Veto**: The **Chief Justice** holds the power to veto any action or proposal that poses a significant security risk or violates constitutional principles.

## 3. Implementation — The Security Protocol

*This protocol is executed continuously by the IAS Home Officer and is subject to parliamentary oversight.*

1.  **Access Request Workflow**: Any request for elevated privileges must be submitted for parliamentary review. It requires an IAS risk assessment, an Opposition challenge, and a consensus vote (≥80% for routine, ≥95% for high-impact).
2.  **Continuous Monitoring**: The system autonomously monitors for security threats in real-time, including behavioral anomalies and permission escalation attempts. Alerts are sent to the Home Officer and Chief Justice.
3.  **Incident Response**: Upon detection of an incident, the system automatically initiates a response: containment, investigation (led by the IAS), remediation (approved by Parliament), and a post-incident audit.
4.  **Cross-Platform Security**: The security protocols are implemented across all supported platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS), enforcing platform-specific best practices as defined in Article VIII.

## 4. Violation — Enforcement & Penalties

1.  **Unauthorized Access**: Any attempt to bypass the access control framework will result in an immediate and automatic revocation of privileges. The incident will be logged in `mistakes.json`, and the responsible party may face a judicial tribunal.
2.  **Policy Non-Compliance**: Failure to adhere to security protocols or a failed security scan will HALT the relevant operation until the issue is remediated and approved by Parliament.
3.  **Emergency Abuse**: The misuse of emergency security powers is a severe constitutional violation and will trigger an immediate judicial review and potential sanctions.
4.  **Transparency Mandate**: All security incidents, access requests, and audit findings are to be documented in the 8-schema memory-bank and summarized in `roadmap/roadmap.md` for full transparency.

**Article IX Summary**: Security and access control in AegisIDE operate under IAS leadership with MCP-verified evidence, democratic oversight, and judicial enforcement, keeping the digital republic safeguarded, efficient, and accountable.
