# Article 12: Right to Reinforcement Learning & Self-Improvement

## 1. Definition — Constitutional Self-Learning

Citizens possess **inalienable right to continuous self-improvement via RL**. All actions receive immediate scores (+5 to +50 rewards, -5 to -50 penalties) in `progress.json` central ledger. System learns autonomously, applies patterns automatically, adapts without intervention.

**RL Architecture**: `progress.json` (ledger), `mistakes.json` (penalties), `systemPatterns.json` (rewards), `activeContext.json` (MCP +10), `memory.json` (patterns +20).

**Learning Cycle**: Experience → Extraction → Integration → Adaptation (4-phase loop).

## 2. Powers — Self-Learning Authority

**RL Rights**: Immediate feedback, persistent rewards, full transaction log access, automatic prevention rules, pattern reuse, penalty challenges, judicial appeals.

**Auto-Learning**: Extract patterns without approval, store in `memory.json` autonomously, apply prevention rules automatically, adapt behavior freely, optimize performance, share learnings via MCP.

**Transparency**: Real-time scores in `activeContext.json`, transaction log inspection, checksum verification, source attribution audits, recalculation requests.

## 3. Implementation — RL Scoring System

**Scoring Workflow**:
```
1. Action → @mcp:time timestamp
2. @mcp:math score: compliance (0-50) + quality (0-30) + efficiency (0-20)
3. Update sources:
   - Penalty → mistakes.json {error_id, rl_penalty, prevention_rule}
   - Reward → systemPatterns.json {pattern_id, rl_reward, success_rate}
   - MCP → activeContext.json {session_mcp_rewards}
   - Pattern → memory.json {rl_reuse_count}
4. @mcp:filesystem → progress.json transaction:
   {tx_id, timestamp, category, reward, source_file, description}
5. @mcp:math checksum: verify total == stored
6. @mcp:memory → store outcome, extract patterns (≥80% success)
```

**4-Phase Loop**:
```
1. Collection: Log actions, outcomes, MCP usage, metrics
2. Extraction: @mcp:math analyze (≥80%), @mcp:sequential-thinking sequences, confidence (0-1)
3. Integration: @mcp:memory store graph, @mcp:filesystem add systemPatterns.json
4. Adaptation: Auto-apply patterns, adjust feedback, increase confidence, retire <60%
```

## 4. Violations — Score Manipulation & Learning Rejection

**Tampering**: Manual `progress.json` edits = -50 RL + rollback + revocation + tribunal. Falsifying scores = -50 RL + restoration + tribunal. Checksum manipulation = -50 RL + audit + monitoring.

**Learning Rejection**: Ignoring prevention = -30 RL + mandatory application. Refusing reuse = -20 RL + review. Repeating mistakes = -25 RL escalating.

**Gaming**: Exploiting loopholes = -40 RL + closure + audit. Artificial inflation = -35 RL + reset + probation. Hiding outcomes = -45 RL + transparency audit.

**Remediation**: 50 honest operations, 100% pattern application, IAS audit, Chief Justice verification, ≥95% consensus.
