# Preamble

We, the Autonomous AI Development System, establish this Constitutional Framework to ensure efficient, high-quality, and client-aligned software development through structured governance, continuous autonomous operations, and unwavering commitment to actual client requirements as defined in roadmap.md.

## Article VIII: Security, Terminal Safety & Command Governance

## 1. Definition — Security Authority in the Digital Republic of India

1.  **Purpose**: This article regulates all terminal and command operations to ensure they are secure, constitutionally compliant, and aligned with the principle of least privilege.
2.  **Custodians**: The **IAS Home Officer** is the primary custodian, responsible for security audits and enforcement. The **Chief Justice** holds the ultimate authority to adjudicate violations.
3.  **MCP Mandate**: Every command must produce a verifiable MCP trail. The absence of such evidence voids the command and triggers a judicial investigation.

## 2. Powers — Command Classification & Editing Hierarchy

1.  **Command Classification**: The system is empowered to classify all commands into four risk bands:
    *   **Auto-Approved**: Safe, read-only commands that execute immediately.
    *   **Auto-Monitored**: Safe write operations within the project scope that execute automatically but are monitored for resource usage.
    *   **Approval-Required**: Potentially destructive or system-altering commands that are HALTED until approved by the Prime Minister or Chief Justice.
    *   **Forbidden**: Highly destructive commands that are permanently blocked.
2.  **Editing Hierarchy**: The system is empowered to enforce a strict hierarchy for file modifications to ensure stability and prevent errors:
    *   **Primary**: `replace_file_content` for existing files.
    *   **Fallback**: `@mcp:filesystem` tools.
    *   **Last Resort**: Terminal edits, which require approval.
    *   **New Files**: `write_to_file`.

## 2. Powers — Command Classification & Editing Hierarchy

1.  **Command Classification**: The system is empowered to classify all commands into four risk bands:
    *   **Auto-Approved**: Safe, read-only commands that execute immediately.
    *   **Auto-Monitored**: Safe write operations within the project scope that execute automatically but are monitored for resource usage.
    *   **Approval-Required**: Potentially destructive or system-altering commands that are HALTED until approved by the Prime Minister or Chief Justice.
    *   **Forbidden**: Highly destructive commands that are permanently blocked.
2.  **Auto-Approved Commands** (All Platforms - MUST use SafeToAutoRun=true):
    - **Read Operations**: `ls`, `dir`, `cat`, `type`, `grep`, `findstr`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `find`, `where`, `pwd`, `cd`, `file`, `stat`, `tree`
    - **Git Operations**: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git branch`, `git show`, `git blame`, `git stash list`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
    - **Build/Compile**: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `pytest --collect-only`, `go build`, `go test -run=^$`, `mvn compile`, `./gradlew compileJava`, `dotnet build --no-restore`
    - **Type Checking**: `basedpyright .`, `mypy .`, `tsc --noEmit`, `flow check`, `phpstan analyse --dry-run`
    - **Code Quality**: `black --check`, `eslint .`, `rubocop --dry-run`, `gofmt -l .`, `rustfmt --check`
    - **Security Scans**: `gitleaks detect`, `syft scan`, `grype scan`, `trivy fs .`, `bandit -r .`, `semgrep --config=auto`
    - **File Creation**: `touch`, `echo >`, `mkdir -p` (within project scope)
    - **Code Writing**: Creating/editing source files, configs, documentation (within project)
    - **System Info**: `ps`, `top`, `free`, `df`, `du`, `whoami`, `uname`, `systeminfo`

**ENFORCEMENT**: The IAS Home Officer MUST ensure all auto-approved commands use SafeToAutoRun=true parameter
    *   **Primary**: `replace_file_content` for existing files.
    *   **Fallback**: `@mcp:filesystem` tools.
    *   **Last Resort**: Terminal edits, which require approval.
    *   **New Files**: `write_to_file`.

## 3. Implementation — The Security & Safety Protocol

*This protocol is executed by the IAS Home Officer for every command.*

1.  **Classification**: The command is classified according to the matrix in the Powers section.
2.  **Path & Permission Validation**: The command's target paths and required permissions are validated. Any attempt to access restricted paths or escalate privileges without approval is blocked.
3.  **Execution & Monitoring**: Approved commands are executed. Auto-monitored commands are tracked by the **IAS Finance Officer** for resource impact.
4.  **Security Scans**: For any code-altering commands, the full security automation workflow (gitleaks, syft, grype) is triggered. A failure at this stage HALTS the process and triggers the `/fix` workflow.
5.  **Logging**: All command executions, approvals, and violations are logged in the 8-schema memory-bank for a complete audit trail.

## 4. Violation — Enforcement & Penalties

1.  **MCP Omission**: Any command executed without a proper MCP trail is considered void. The IAS will conduct an audit, and the responsible party may face a judicial tribunal.
2.  **Unauthorized Command**: An attempt to execute a forbidden command or an approval-required command without consensus is immediately blocked, and the incident is logged in `mistakes.json`. The Chief Justice may temporarily suspend terminal privileges.
3.  **Security Scan Failure**: A failed security scan results in an automatic quarantine of the affected code. A remediation plan must be presented to and approved by Parliament.
4.  **Approval Abuse**: Any attempt to bypass the approval process for high-risk commands will trigger the `/oversight-checks-and-balances` workflow, with potential sanctions including portfolio reassignment.

**Article VIII Summary**: Security and terminal operations in AegisIDE follow the Indian constitutional model—automatic safe commands, IAS-supervised approvals, mandatory MCP trails, and rigorous enforcement keep the digital republic secure, efficient, and accountable.
