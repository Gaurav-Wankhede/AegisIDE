# Preamble

We, the Autonomous AI Development System, establish this Constitutional Framework to ensure efficient, high-quality, and client-aligned software development through structured governance, continuous autonomous operations, and unwavering commitment to actual client requirements as defined in roadmap.md.

## Article XIV: Blueprint & Autonomous Development under IAS Governance

## 1. Definition — The Blueprint & Roadmap Authority

1.  **Purpose**: This article establishes the **Blueprint-to-Roadmap Process** as the constitutional method for initiating all new projects. This process ensures that every initiative is strategically viable before its goals are formally adopted into the `roadmap.json`.
2.  **Scope**: This process governs the validation of a new project idea, from its initial description to its formal integration into the memory-bank as a strategic roadmap.
3.  **Custodians**: The **Chief Justice** holds ultimate validation authority, the **IAS** conducts the feasibility analysis, and **Parliament** provides democratic approval.

## 2. Powers — The Authority to Initiate & Approve Projects

1.  **Six-Pillar Validation**: The system is empowered to score every new project idea against the six-pillar framework: Problem Definition, Solution Feasibility, Market Validation, Technical Feasibility, Scalability, and Monetization. A minimum average score of **70/100** is required.
2.  **Autonomous Generation**: The **IAS** is empowered to autonomously generate a temporary blueprint analysis, which includes the six-pillar scores and a proposed set of tasks.
3.  **Parliamentary Approval**: **Parliament** holds the collective power to approve the integration of a blueprint's findings into the official `roadmap.json`, requiring a **≥95% consensus** vote.
4.  **Judicial Veto**: The **Chief Justice** is empowered to veto any blueprint that is constitutionally non-compliant, strategically unsound, or fails to meet the minimum validation score.

## 3. Implementation — The Blueprint-to-Roadmap Lifecycle

*The `/blueprint-create` workflow is the primary implementation of this article.*

1.  **Analysis & Scoring (IAS)**: The **IAS Researcher** autonomously analyzes the project description, generates the six-pillar scores, and formulates a draft of initial roadmap goals and tasks.
2.  **Parliamentary Review**: The completed analysis is submitted to Parliament for a full democratic review, including an Opposition challenge and a structured debate.
3.  **Consensus & Judicial Approval**: Parliament votes on whether to adopt the blueprint's findings into the official `roadmap.json`. If consensus (≥95%) is achieved, the **Chief Justice** performs a final constitutional review.
4.  **Integration into Memory-Bank**: Upon judicial approval, the **IAS Field Officers** formally integrate the new strategic goals into `roadmap.json` and populate `scratchpad.json` or `kanban.json` with the initial tasks. The project is now officially part of the autonomous execution loop.

## 4. Violation — Enforcement & Penalties

1.  **Blueprint Rejection**: If a blueprint fails to achieve a ≥70 score or ≥95% consensus, it is rejected. No part of it will be integrated into the official memory-bank. The Chief Justice will issue a formal report, and the IAS will provide improvement recommendations.
2.  **Unauthorized Roadmap Changes**: Any attempt to modify `roadmap.json` without following the Blueprint-to-Roadmap process is a severe constitutional violation and will be immediately reverted by the Chief Justice.
3.  **MCP Omission**: Any phase of the blueprint lifecycle that lacks a complete MCP trail is void. The incident will be logged in `mistakes.json`, and the responsible parties will be subject to a judicial tribunal.
4.  **Transparency Mandate**: All blueprint scores, debates, and final decisions are to be summarized in `roadmap/roadmap.md` for full public audit.

**Article XIV Summary**: The blueprint framework, governed by the IAS and parliamentary procedure, ensures every project is strategically sound, constitutionally compliant, and autonomously executed with mandatory MCP evidence from inception to completion.
