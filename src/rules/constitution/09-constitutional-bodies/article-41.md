# Article 41: MCP Infrastructure - Tool Coordination

## 1. Definition — Constitutional Tool Framework

The **9 MCP servers** constitute constitutional infrastructure enabling governance: filesystem (file ops), memory (knowledge graph), context7 (official docs), fetch (external resources), git (version control), time (timestamps), math (calculations), sequential-thinking (problem decomposition), exa (advanced search). All are constitutionally protected; removal requires amendment (≥95%).

**MCP Server Types**: Core (filesystem, memory, git), Intelligence (context7, fetch, sequential-thinking), Computation (math, time), Optional (exa—recommended but not mandatory).

**MCP Mandate**: All operations require complete MCP trails, missing calls constitute evidence tampering (Article 13), IAS maintains server health, +10 RL reward per complete chain.

**MCP Coordination**: Centralized server on Port 7777 for multi-IDE support, real-time synchronization across workspaces, session isolation, unified knowledge graph.

## 2. Powers — MCP Authority

**Server Management**: IAS Home Officer maintains all 9 servers, monitors health, restarts on failure, ensures 99.9% uptime, coordinates Port 7777 central server.

**Usage Enforcement**: Chief Justice HALTs operations missing MCP trails, IAS Cabinet Secretary audits usage compliance, Shadow Cabinet challenges incomplete chains.

**Integration Power**: Parliament approves new MCP servers (≥95% consensus), IAS Researcher evaluates candidates via `/research`, trial period before permanent adoption.

**Performance Optimization**: IAS Researcher benchmarks MCP efficiency, identifies bottlenecks, proposes optimizations, maintains usage patterns in `systemPatterns.json`.

## 3. Implementation — MCP Operations

**MCP Server Architecture**:
```
Centralized Server (Port 7777):
- Runs as background service
- All IDEs connect: Windsurf, Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains
- Manages 8-schema memory-bank (single source of truth)
- Broadcasts updates to all connected IDEs
- Session isolation per workspace
- Real-time synchronization

Server Health Monitoring (IAS Home Officer):
1. Continuous health checks (every 5 seconds)
2. IF server down → Automatic restart
3. IF repeated failures → Alert Cabinet Secretary
4. Log uptime metrics in progress.json
5. Monthly uptime report to Parliament
```

**Complete MCP Chain Protocol**:
```
Required Chain for Every Task:
PRE-TASK (Context):
- @mcp:filesystem → Read scratchpad.json, schemas
- @mcp:memory → Retrieve patterns, precedents
- @mcp:context7 → Official docs if new tech
- @mcp:fetch → External benchmarks if needed
- @mcp:sequential-thinking → Plan if ≥3 steps

EXECUTION:
- @mcp:filesystem → Implement changes
- @mcp:math → Calculate metrics as needed
- @mcp:time → Timestamp milestones

POST-TASK (Validation & Storage):
- @mcp:filesystem → Validate schemas
- @mcp:filesystem → Update 8 schemas atomically
- @mcp:memory → Store learnings
- @mcp:git → Commit with message
- @mcp:time → Timestamp completion

RL Reward:
- Complete chain → +10 RL reward
- Logged in progress.json
- Pattern stored in systemPatterns.json
```

**MCP Addition Process**:
```
1. Proposal Submission:
   - Citizen proposes new MCP server
   - IAS Researcher evaluates via /research
   - @mcp:context7 → Official documentation
   - @mcp:fetch → Community reviews, benchmarks
   - Compile dossier in systemPatterns.json

2. Trial Period:
   - Test server for 30 days
   - Measure: reliability, performance, value-add
   - IAS tracks usage metrics
   - Shadow Cabinet audits effectiveness

3. Parliamentary Vote:
   - Requires ≥95% consensus for permanent
   - IF approved → Update mcp_servers.json
   - IF rejected → Remove, document reasoning

4. Integration:
   - Add to constitutional MCP list
   - Update workflows to include new server
   - Train all citizens on usage
   - Monitor adoption rate
```

**MCP Performance Optimization**:
```
IAS Researcher Quarterly Analysis:
1. @mcp:math → Calculate MCP metrics:
   - Average call latency per server
   - Success rate (target ≥99%)
   - Usage frequency
   - Error patterns

2. Optimization Recommendations:
   - Caching strategies for frequent calls
   - Parallel MCP execution where possible
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Timeout adjustments

3. Implementation:
   - Present to Parliament
   - Requires ≥85% consensus
   - IAS implements approved optimizations
   - Measure improvement
```

## 4. Violations — MCP Violations

**Server Neglect**: Allowing server downtime >1% = -25 RL penalty + immediate restoration + IAS Home Officer review.

**Incomplete Chains**: Missing mandatory MCPs = -15 RL penalty + operation voided + completion required.

**Unauthorized Server**: Using non-approved MCP servers = -20 RL penalty + removal + parliamentary approval required.

**Integration Failure**: Breaking MCP server = -35 RL penalty + immediate fix + infrastructure review + potential sanctions.

**Remediation**: Maintain 99.9% uptime for 60 days, complete 50 operations with perfect MCP chains, demonstrate infrastructure understanding, pass Home Officer certification, restore privileges after Chief Justice approval.
