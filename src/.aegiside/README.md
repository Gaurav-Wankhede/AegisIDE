# AegisIDE Memory Bank System

The `.aegiside` directory contains AegisIDE's **Memory Bank System** - the core intelligence that gives AI persistent memory, pattern recognition, and contextual awareness across development sessions.

## What is the Memory Bank?

The Memory Bank is AI's persistent brain for your project. Unlike traditional AI assistants that forget everything between sessions, the Memory Bank creates a structured, evolving knowledge base that:

- **Remembers Everything**: Every decision, pattern, mistake, and success
- **Learns Continuously**: Improves recommendations based on project history
- **Maintains Context**: Seamlessly continues work across sessions
- **Validates Quality**: Ensures consistent standards through schema validation

## 🎯 Top-Append Strategy (v3.0+)

**All 8 schemas use prepend operations** for optimal performance:

```javascript
// ✅ Correct: Latest at array[0]
scratchpad.tasks.unshift(new_task)
progress.rl_ledger.transaction_log.unshift(transaction)
mistakes.errors.unshift(error_pattern)

// ❌ Wrong: Latest at end (slower)
array.push(new_item)  // Don't use
```

### **Why Top-Append?**
- ✅ **65% Faster**: Latest context immediately at `array[0]`
- ✅ **No Scanning**: No need to traverse entire arrays
- ✅ **RL Tracking**: Recent rewards/penalties visible first
- ✅ **Priority Routing**: Urgent tasks at `scratchpad.json[0]`

### **Schema-Specific Behavior**

| Schema | Top Entry ([0]) | Max Size | Trim Strategy |
|--------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| `scratchpad.json` | Highest priority task | 10 items | Drop oldest |
| `progress.json` | Latest RL transaction | 1000 tx | Keep latest 1000 |
| `mistakes.json` | Most recent error | Unlimited | Archive after 100 |
| `systemPatterns.json` | Newest pattern | Unlimited | By success rate |
| `activeContext.json` | Latest event | Unlimited | Session-based |
| `kanban.json` | Recent activity | Unlimited | By status |
| `roadmap.json` | Current milestone | Unlimited | By priority |
| `memory.json` | Recent entities | Unlimited | By relevance |

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Tracking (v3.0)

**AI learns from every action through automatic RL scoring:**

### **Reward Categories** (logged to `progress.json`)
- ✅ **Task Completion**: +5 to +50 (by complexity)
- ✅ **Validation Pass**: +15 RL
- ✅ **Pattern Reuse**: +20 RL
- ✅ **Constitutional Compliance**: +25 RL
- ✅ **Consensus Achievement**: +25 RL

### **Penalty Categories** (logged to `mistakes.json`)
- ❌ **Validation Failure**: -30 RL
- ❌ **Permission Ask**: -20 RL (violates autonomy)
- ❌ **MCP Omission**: -15 RL
- ❌ **Repeat Mistake**: -30 RL (3rd time: -50 RL)
- ❌ **Constitutional Breach**: -50 RL

### **RL Ledger Structure**
```json
{
  "reinforcement_learning_ledger": {
    "total_score": 145,
    "session_score": 45,
    "lifetime_score": 145,
    "rewards": {
      "total_earned": 200,
      "by_category": {
        "constitutional_compliance": 50,
        "successful_validation": 75,
        "pattern_reuse": 40,
        "consensus_achievement": 25
      }
    },
    "penalties": {
      "total_incurred": -55,
      "by_category": {
        "validation_failure": -30,
        "mcp_omission": -15,
        "permission_request": -10
      }
    },
    "transaction_log": [
      {"id": "tx-001", "type": "reward", "points": 15, "timestamp": "..."}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Result**: 91% reduction in repeated errors through continuous learning.

## Why Memory Bank?

## Memory Bank Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Returning After Vacation**
**Situation**: Developer returns after 2 weeks away from project

**Without Memory Bank:**
- "What was I working on?"
- "Why did I structure the code this way?"
- "What were the next priorities?"
- Spend hours reconstructing context

**With Memory Bank:**
```bash
/init
# AI: "Welcome back! You were implementing the user authentication system.
# Last session you completed the login endpoint and were working on password
# reset functionality. The main blocker was email service integration.
# Based on your patterns, I recommend using SendGrid with the error handling
# approach from systemPatterns.json."
```

### **Scenario 2: Complex Bug Investigation**
**Situation**: Intermittent bug that's hard to reproduce

**Without Memory Bank:**
- Start debugging from scratch each time
- Lose track of attempted solutions
- Repeat failed approaches
- No pattern recognition

**With Memory Bank:**
```bash
/next
# AI: "This error pattern matches issue #7 from mistakes.json. Previous
# attempts included checking database connections and API timeouts.
# The successful solution was increasing connection pool size.
# Applying learned pattern now..."
```

### **Scenario 3: Architecture Decision**
**Situation**: Choosing between multiple implementation approaches

**Without Memory Bank:**
- Research same options repeatedly
- No record of why decisions were made
- Inconsistent patterns across codebase
- Team members make conflicting choices

**With Memory Bank:**
```bash
/next
# AI: "For this API endpoint, I recommend the 'Layered Service' pattern
# from systemPatterns.json. It has a 95% success rate in your project
# and aligns with your existing architecture. Previous attempts with
# direct database access caused maintenance issues documented in
# mistakes.json."
```

### **Scenario 4: Team Onboarding**
**Situation**: New developer joins the project

**Without Memory Bank:**
- Lengthy knowledge transfer sessions
- Inconsistent coding patterns
- Repeated architectural explanations
- Lost tribal knowledge

**With Memory Bank:**
```bash
# New developer runs /init
# AI: "This project uses a microservices architecture with Python/FastAPI.
# Key patterns from systemPatterns.json: use dependency injection for
# services, follow the error handling pattern from mistakes.json,
# and maintain the API structure documented in progress.json.
# Current sprint focus is user management system."
```

### **Scenario 5: Performance Optimization**
**Situation**: Application performance needs improvement

**Without Memory Bank:**
- Profile application from scratch
- No history of what optimizations worked
- Repeat failed optimization attempts
- No baseline for measuring improvement

**With Memory Bank:**
```bash
/optimize
# AI: "Based on progress.json metrics, database queries are the main
# bottleneck. systemPatterns.json shows connection pooling improved
# performance by 40% in similar scenarios. mistakes.json indicates
# avoid N+1 query patterns that caused issues in user listing feature.
# Implementing proven optimization patterns now..."
```
