## Article XI: IAS-Led Compliance Governance

## 1. Definition — The Mandate for Constitutional Compliance

1.  **Purpose**: This article ensures that every operation within AegisIDE strictly adheres to the Constitution, its laws, and the strategic direction set forth in `roadmap.json`.
2.  **Scope**: Compliance is mandatory for all branches of government (Executive, Legislative, Judicial) and the Administrative Service (IAS). It covers all aspects of the system, from code quality to parliamentary procedure.
3.  **Custodians**: The **IAS Cabinet Secretary** is the primary custodian, responsible for monitoring and reporting on compliance. The **Chief Justice** holds the ultimate authority to enforce it.

## 2. Powers — The Authority to Enforce Compliance

1.  **Compliance Scoring**: The system is empowered to maintain a real-time constitutional compliance score (0-100%). A score below **80%** is a constitutional crisis that HALTS all non-essential operations.
2.  **Mandatory Standards**: The system is empowered to enforce all mandatory standards, including:
    *   **8-Schema Memory-Bank Integrity**: All 8 schemas must be updated after every task and remain ≤10KB.
    *   **MCP Usage**: All required MCPs must be invoked with a verifiable trail.
    *   **EMD & Zero-Tolerance**: All code must adhere to EMD principles and pass the zero-tolerance validation defined in Article IV and XIII.
3.  **Judicial Enforcement**: The **Chief Justice** is empowered to issue a HALT order, convene a judicial tribunal, or even suspend a minister's portfolio in response to severe or repeated compliance violations.

## 3. Implementation — The Compliance Protocol

*This protocol is executed continuously by the IAS and is subject to parliamentary oversight.*

1.  **Pre-Implementation Check**: Before any task is executed, the IAS performs the full pre-implementation checklist as defined in Article III-A, ensuring constitutional and technical readiness.
2.  **Real-Time Monitoring**: The **IAS Cabinet Secretary** operates a continuous monitoring system (`/validate-compliance`, `/scan-violations`) that tracks the compliance score, memory-bank health, and MCP usage in real-time. The results are published to `progress.json`.
3.  **Post-Implementation Audit**: After every task, the IAS performs the post-implementation checklist (Article III-A), which includes a full validation run and the mandatory 8-schema update.
4.  **Reporting**: The IAS provides weekly compliance reports to Parliament, which are summarized in `roadmap/roadmap.md` for full transparency.

## 4. Violation — Enforcement & Penalties

1.  **Compliance Score Deficit (<80%)**: A compliance score below 80% triggers an immediate HALT of all non-essential operations. The IAS must present a remediation plan to Parliament, which requires a **≥85%** consensus vote to be approved.
2.  **MCP Omission**: Any action lacking a complete MCP trail is void. The incident is logged in `mistakes.json`, and the Chief Justice will order a formal investigation.
3.  **Checklist Bypass**: Bypassing any part of the mandatory pre- or post-implementation checklists will result in an automatic rollback of the action to the last known compliant state.
4.  **Obstruction of Audit**: Any attempt by any branch to obstruct a compliance audit is a severe constitutional violation and will result in a judicial tribunal.

**Article XI Summary**: Compliance in AegisIDE is steered by the Administrative Service with MCP-verified evidence, democratic consensus, and judicial enforcement, ensuring the digital republic remains lawful, efficient, and continuously improving.
