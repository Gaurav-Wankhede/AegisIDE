# AegisIDE Memory Bank - AI's Persistent Intelligence

The memory-bank is AegisIDE's core intelligence system - a structured, persistent memory that allows AI to maintain complete project context across sessions, learn from patterns, and make informed decisions.

## What is the Memory Bank?

Think of the memory-bank as the AI's "brain" for your project. It stores:
- **Current Context**: What the AI is working on right now
- **Task Management**: Prioritized work queue and project board
- **Learning History**: Mistakes made and lessons learned
- **Architecture Knowledge**: Coding patterns and system design
- **Progress Tracking**: Milestones, metrics, and strategic goals
- **Relationship Mapping**: How different parts of your project connect

## The 8 Core Schemas

Each schema serves a specific purpose in maintaining AI intelligence:

### 1. **activeContext.json** - Current Focus
```json
{
  "current_phase": "Implementation",
  "active_tasks": ["Fix authentication bug", "Add user validation"],
  "session_context": "Working on user management system",
  "last_updated": "2025-10-09T17:00:00Z"
}
```
**Purpose**: Tracks what AI is currently working on, ensuring seamless session continuity.

### 2. **scratchpad.json** - Task Queue
```json
{
  "immediate_priorities": [
    {
      "id": "task_001",
      "description": "Implement user registration endpoint",
      "priority": "high",
      "estimated_time": "2 hours"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Maintains prioritized list of next 5-10 tasks, automatically updated as work progresses.

### 3. **kanban.json** - Project Board
```json
{
  "columns": {
    "todo": ["Design database schema"],
    "in_progress": ["Implement authentication"],
    "done": ["Set up project structure"]
  }
}
```
**Purpose**: Visual task management with workflow states, dependencies, and progress tracking.

### 4. **mistakes.json** - Learning System
```json
{
  "error_patterns": [
    {
      "error_type": "Import Error",
      "description": "Missing __init__.py in Python packages",
      "solution": "Always create __init__.py files",
      "frequency": 3
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Captures errors and solutions, enabling AI to learn and prevent repeated mistakes.

### 5. **systemPatterns.json** - Architecture Knowledge
```json
{
  "successful_patterns": [
    {
      "pattern_name": "API Error Handling",
      "implementation": "Use try-catch with specific error types",
      "success_rate": 95,
      "use_cases": ["REST endpoints", "Database operations"]
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Stores proven architectural patterns and coding standards for consistent implementation.

### 6. **progress.json** - Development Metrics
```json
{
  "milestones": [
    {
      "name": "MVP Release",
      "completion_percentage": 75,
      "target_date": "2025-11-01",
      "status": "on_track"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Tracks project milestones, velocity metrics, and strategic progress indicators.

### 7. **roadmap.json** - Strategic Planning
```json
{
  "strategic_objectives": [
    {
      "objective": "Launch user authentication system",
      "priority": "critical",
      "business_value": "Enable user accounts and personalization"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Maintains high-level project goals and business alignment for strategic decision-making.

### 8. **memory.json** - Knowledge Graph
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "UserService",
      "type": "component",
      "relations": ["connects_to: Database", "used_by: AuthController"]
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Maps relationships between project components, creating a knowledge graph for intelligent reasoning.

## How It Works

### **Automatic Updates**
- **Every Task**: AI updates relevant schemas after completing work
- **Session Continuity**: AI reads memory-bank at session start to restore context
- **Pattern Learning**: Successful approaches are automatically captured
- **Error Prevention**: Past mistakes inform future decisions

### **Schema Validation**
- **JSON Schemas**: Each memory file validated against strict schema definitions
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents corruption and ensures consistent structure
- **Type Safety**: Enforces correct data types and required fields
- **Automatic Healing**: Invalid data is automatically corrected

### **Cross-Schema Intelligence**
- **Task Dependencies**: scratchpad.json links to kanban.json for workflow management
- **Error Learning**: mistakes.json patterns influence systemPatterns.json recommendations
- **Progress Tracking**: activeContext.json updates drive progress.json metrics
- **Strategic Alignment**: All schemas reference roadmap.json for business context

## Real-World Benefits

### **For Solo Developers**
```
Before AegisIDE:
❌ "What was I working on yesterday?"
❌ "Why did I choose this approach?"
❌ "I keep making the same mistakes"
❌ "Lost track of project goals"

After AegisIDE:
✅ AI instantly recalls exact context
✅ Architecture decisions documented
✅ Mistakes become learning opportunities
✅ Strategic alignment maintained
```

### **For Development Teams**
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Team patterns captured in systemPatterns.json
- **Onboarding**: New developers inherit project intelligence
- **Consistency**: Shared memory-bank ensures uniform approaches
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time project status across team

### **For Long-Term Projects**
- **Context Preservation**: Project knowledge maintained over months/years
- **Evolution Tracking**: See how project architecture evolved
- **Decision History**: Understand why specific choices were made
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify what works best for your domain

## Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: Returning After Break**
```bash
# After 2 weeks away from project
/init

# AI reads memory-bank and says:
"Welcome back! You were implementing the user authentication system. 
Last session you completed the login endpoint and were working on 
password reset functionality. The main blocker was email service 
integration. Based on past patterns, I recommend using SendGrid 
with the error handling pattern from systemPatterns.json."
```

### **Scenario 2: Debugging Complex Issue**
```bash
# Encountering a bug
/next

# AI checks mistakes.json and says:
"This error pattern matches issue #3 from mistakes.json. Last time 
this occurred, the solution was updating the database connection 
timeout. Applying the same fix now..."
```

### **Scenario 3: Architecture Decision**
```bash
# Choosing implementation approach
/next

# AI references systemPatterns.json:
"For this API endpoint, I recommend using the 'Layered Service' 
pattern from systemPatterns.json. It has a 95% success rate in 
similar use cases and aligns with your existing architecture."
```
