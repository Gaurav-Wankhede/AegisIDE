# AegisIDE - AI Governance Framework

**AegisIDE** is a constitutional framework that transforms AI-powered development through democratic governance, persistent memory, and autonomous workflows. It provides structure, accountability, and continuity for AI development assistants.

## What is AegisIDE?

AegisIDE creates a "digital republic" where AI operates under constitutional law with three branches of governance:
- **Executive**: Implements tasks and manages development
- **Legislative**: Reviews quality and challenges decisions  
- **Judicial**: Enforces validation and constitutional compliance

This ensures AI development is reliable, accountable, and maintains high quality standards.

## Use Cases

### ðŸš€ **New Project Development**
```bash
# 1. Describe your project to AI
"Build a job scraper with Python, Selenium, and Streamlit"

# 2. Initialize AegisIDE
/init

# 3. AI creates complete project structure and begins development
/next
```

**What happens:**
- AI creates 8 memory files tailored to your project
- Generates roadmap with milestones and tasks
- Sets up quality validation for your tech stack
- Begins autonomous development with oversight

### ðŸ”§ **Existing Project Enhancement**
```bash
# 1. Point AI to your existing codebase
/init

# 2. AI analyzes and creates governance structure
# 3. Continues development with improved quality and tracking
```

**What happens:**
- AI analyzes your existing code and patterns
- Creates memory-bank reflecting current state
- Identifies technical debt and improvement opportunities
- Provides structured development going forward

### ðŸ‘¥ **Team Collaboration**
- **Consistent Standards**: All team members use same governance framework
