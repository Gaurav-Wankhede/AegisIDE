# Constitutional Code of Conduct

**AegisIDE Constitutional Framework** - Democratic Governance for AI Development

## Constitutional Authority

This Code of Conduct operates under the **Constitutional Framework for AI Agents** with **democratic parliamentary governance** and **judicial review**.

## Our Constitutional Pledge

We pledge to maintain a **constitutional democracy** in our project community where:
- **Democratic consensus ≥95%** governs major decisions
- **Constitutional compliance ≥80%** is mandatory for all contributions
- **Parliamentary procedure** ensures fair representation and accountability
- **Judicial review** provides independent oversight and constitutional interpretation

## Democratic Standards

### **Government (Ruling Party)**
- **Respectful Leadership**: Project maintainers provide strategic guidance with transparency
- **Technical Excellence**: Code contributions follow EMD compliance (≤80 lines per file)
- **6 Core Protocols**: Anti-Duplication, File Editing Hierarchy (v2.6.0), Session Continuity, Multi-Language Validation, Pattern Recognition, Autonomous Startup
- **Innovation**: Embrace always-check operations and constitutional validation

### **Opposition (Shadow Cabinet)**
- **Constructive Challenges**: Quality-focused criticism with evidence-based alternatives
- **Accountability**: Hold government decisions to constitutional compliance standards
- **Research-Based Input**: Data-driven feedback and empirical analysis

### **Independent Judiciary**
- **Constitutional Review**: Ensure all actions comply with democratic principles
- **Impartial Mediation**: Resolve conflicts through constitutional interpretation
- **Precedent Establishment**: Create consistent standards for future decisions

## Unacceptable Behavior

### **Constitutional Violations**
- **Bypassing Democratic Process**: Making major decisions without ≥95% consensus
- **Ignoring Opposition**: Dismissing quality challenges without evidence-based response
- **Constitutional Non-Compliance**: Submitting contributions that violate framework principles
- **Judicial Interference**: Attempting to influence or bypass judicial review

### **Community Standards Violations**
- Harassment, discrimination, or abuse in any form
- Disrespectful or destructive communication
- Sharing private information without consent
- Professional misconduct in project spaces

## Democratic Enforcement Process

### **Parliamentary Procedure**
1. **Report Incident** → Submit to constitutional review
2. **Opposition Review** → Shadow cabinet investigates and challenges if warranted
3. **Structured Debate** → Parliamentary discussion with evidence scoring
4. **Consensus Calculation** → Democratic vote requiring ≥95% agreement
5. **Judicial Review** → Chief Justice validates constitutional compliance
6. **Implementation** → Enforcement action with accountability audit

### **Enforcement Actions**
- **Warning**: Formal notice with constitutional education
- **Temporary Suspension**: Time-limited restriction with rehabilitation plan
- **Permanent Ban**: Complete removal following due process
- **Constitutional Amendment**: Framework updates for unprecedented situations

### **Appeals Process**
- **Constitutional Appeal**: Right to judicial review of any enforcement action
- **Parliamentary Override**: Super-majority (≥95%) can overturn judicial decisions
- **Precedent Review**: Establish consistent standards for similar future cases
