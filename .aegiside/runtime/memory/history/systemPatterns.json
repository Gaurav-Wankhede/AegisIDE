Tested: (1) Bootstrap verification (both workspaces pass), (2) Router loading via jq (NOT read_file - tool enforcement), (3) Memory bank access via @mcp:json-jq (activeContext, kanban, systemPatterns loaded), (4) Mandatory research (called @mcp:context7 + @mcp:exa despite confidence 0.75<0.8), (5) Git history analysis (5 recent commits reviewed), (6) Architecture patterns extraction (auto_learning enabled, 12 existing patterns), (7) Test suite execution (150+ test assertions across 7 shell scripts), (8) Constitutional flow validation (governance queries priority=critical), (9) ACE workflow demonstration (Generate→Reflect→Curate via pattern storage), (10) 10-point pre-response verification protocol. Framework operates correctly in practice: 15-step sequential thinking completed BEFORE any action, correct tool routing (jq for knowledge/, @mcp:json-jq for memory/), research conducted when required, patterns stored for anti-amnesia. Key insight: Framework definition (Portfolio/AegisIDE) provides governance rules that AI agent executes autonomously - this test validates the agent follows rules without human intervention.",
