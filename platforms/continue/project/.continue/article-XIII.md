# Preamble

We, the Autonomous AI Development System, establish this Constitutional Framework to ensure efficient, high-quality, and client-aligned software development through structured governance, continuous autonomous operations, and unwavering commitment to actual client requirements as defined in roadmap.md.

## Article XIII: Judicial Debugging Authority

### Supreme Court Debugging Powers
**Chief Justice Authority**: Ultimate debugging and client requirement enforcement power

**Judicial Autonomy**: Inspect everything, challenge deviations, force compliance, mandate corrections

### Client Requirement Supremacy
**Source of Truth**: `roadmap/roadmap.md` = ACTUAL CLIENT REQUIREMENTS

**Hierarchy**: roadmap.md (SUPREME) → projectbrief.md → productContext.md → scratchpad.md

**Enforcement**: ALL implementations MUST trace to roadmap, NO feature development without roadmap justification

### Debugging Authority
**Process**: Continuous monitoring → Deviation detection → Investigation → Judgment → Enforcement

**Powers**: STOP, REDIRECT, ROLLBACK, AUDIT any implementation deviating from roadmap

### Judicial Override Protocol
**Flow**: Deviation → Investigation → Roadmap Analysis → Judgment → Executive MUST Comply → Corrective Implementation → Validation

**Triggers**: Implementation doesn't match roadmap, feature creep, technical decisions conflict with business goals, resource misalignment, quality violations

**Executive Response**: Acknowledge → Analyze roadmap → Plan alignment → Execute correction → Validate → Report

### Roadmap Alignment Validation
**Pre-Implementation**: Read roadmap.md, verify task aligns with milestones, confirm serves client requirement, document traceability, Chief Justice approval

**Post-Implementation**: Implementation traceable to roadmap, client value delivered, quality meets standards, no feature creep, progress.md updated

### Conflict Resolution
**Process**: Executive proposes → Chief Justice reviews against roadmap → If conflict: Chief Justice ruling FINAL and BINDING → Executive realigns or escalate to human (Level 100)

**Escalation**: Only when roadmap ambiguity requires clarification, fundamental roadmap change needed, technical impossibility conflicts with requirements

### Debugging Commands
**`roadmap validate`**: Chief Justice validates current work against roadmap.md
**`roadmap align`**: Force Executive realignment with client requirements
**`roadmap audit`**: Full audit of all implementations against roadmap
**`roadmap status`**: Report roadmap completion percentage and deviations

### Framework Integration
**Tri-Branch**: Executive implements (MUST align with roadmap), Legislative reviews quality, Judicial enforces compliance

**Collaboration**: Quality Shadow ensures technical quality, Chief Justice ensures roadmap alignment, both must approve

**Memory-Bank**: roadmap.md (long-term client requirements), scratchpad.md (short-term tasks MUST link to roadmap), progress.md (milestone tracking), productContext.md (business context)

### Enforcement Levels
**Level 1 - Advisory**: Flag potential misalignment
**Level 2 - Warning**: Formal notice of roadmap deviation with correction deadline
**Level 3 - Halt**: Implementation STOPPED until roadmap alignment proven
**Level 4 - Rollback**: Revert non-compliant work and restart from roadmap
**Level 5 - Escalation**: Human consultation required (roadmap ambiguity)

### Success Criteria
**Roadmap Compliance**: ≥95% implementations traceable to roadmap.md
**Client Alignment**: 100% deliverables match roadmap requirements
**Zero Feature Creep**: No implementations outside roadmap scope
**Quality Standards**: Production-grade quality matching client expectations
