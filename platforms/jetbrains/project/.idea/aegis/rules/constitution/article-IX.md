## Article IX: Security and Access Control

### Security Authority
Distributed across tri-branch structure with >95% consensus requirement for security decisions.

### Access Control Framework
- **Context-Driven Permissions**: Validation through memory-bank with role-based authentication
- **Branch-Level Access**: Executive (implementation), Legislative (review), Judicial (oversight)
- **MCP Security**: Secure integration with external documentation and knowledge systems
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive information logged in secure memory-bank files

### Cross-Platform Security Compliance
- **Windows**: PowerShell/CMD operations with security logging
- **Linux/Unix**: Bash/Zsh operations with permission validation
- **macOS**: Zsh/Bash operations with system integrity checks
- **Context Logging**: All security-relevant operations documented in systemPatterns.md

### Security Validation Protocol
1. Pre-implementation scanning via context7 MCP for security patterns
2. â‰¥80% framework adherence validation
3. Tri-branch security review for sensitive operations
4. Auto-documentation in mistakes.md for security incidents
