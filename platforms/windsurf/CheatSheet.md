# AegisIDE Quick Start Guide (2025)

> **For Beginners & Stakeholders**: This guide explains how AegisIDE's AI works autonomously using a democratic governance system inspired by the Indian Constitution.

## üéØ What You Need to Know

AegisIDE uses an **8-file memory system** (like a digital brain) to remember your project's context. The AI operates with **99.5% autonomy**, making most decisions automatically while following constitutional rules.

**Think of it like the Indian Government**:
- üèõÔ∏è **Prime Minister** (Project Manager) - Leads the AI team
- üë• **Ministers** - Implement features (Development & Technology)
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Opposition** - Quality checks and challenges (Quality, Innovation, Analytics)
- üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Chief Justice** - Ensures constitutional compliance
- üìã **IAS Officers** - Administrative experts who maintain project memory

## ‚ö° Essential Commands (What You Actually Use)

### üöÄ Start/Resume Your Project
- **`init`** - Sets up a new project or restores an existing one
  - Creates the 8-file memory system automatically
  - Loads your project's constitution and rules
  - Ready to work in seconds!

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Work Continuously
- **`next`** - AI automatically does the next task
  - Works continuously without asking permission
  - Updates all 8 memory files after each task
  - Chains tasks together seamlessly

### üîÑ Refresh Project Memory
- **`update`** - Refreshes all project memory files
  - Updates the 8 core files (context, tasks, patterns, etc.)
  - Also updates optional automation files if your project has them
  - Keeps everything synchronized

### ‚úÖ Check Quality
- **`validate`** - Runs quality checks on your code
  - Checks JSON structure and data integrity
  - Runs language-specific tests (if applicable)
  - Reports what's working and what needs fixing

- **`fix`** - Automatically fixes errors
  - Detects problems and fixes them
  - Re-validates until everything is clean
  - Updates bug tracking automatically

### üìä Monitor Progress
- **`status`** - Shows project overview
  - Current tasks and completion rates
  - Bug counts and metrics
  - Overall health score

- **`health`** - Checks system health
  - Memory usage and efficiency
  - Data quality (context rot detection)
  - JSON file integrity

- **`optimize`** - Suggests improvements
  - Analyzes patterns in your project
  - Recommends better approaches
  - Finds bottlenecks

- **`research`** - Finds better solutions
  - IAS Researcher analyzes algorithms
  - Discovers lightweight, free-tier optimizations
  - Stores findings for future use

## ü§ñ How Autonomous is the AI?

The AI works at different autonomy levels based on task complexity:

- **0-98% Autonomy** (Most Tasks)
  - ‚úÖ AI executes immediately without asking
  - ‚úÖ Handles routine coding, bug fixes, feature implementation
  - ‚úÖ Chains tasks automatically - never stops mid-work

- **99% Autonomy** (Important Decisions)
  - üìù AI documents its reasoning first
  - ‚úÖ Then executes automatically
  - üìä Used for architectural decisions

- **100% Autonomy** (Critical Choices)
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è AI pauses and asks for your input
  - ü§î Major changes, strategic pivots, or constitutional amendments
  - üë§ You make the final call

---

## üîÑ How Continuous Execution Works

```
1. Complete a Task
2. Update ALL 8 Memory Files (brain refresh)
3. Validate Quality (zero errors policy)
4. Load Next Task Automatically
5. Execute Without Stopping
6. Repeat Until Backlog Clear
```

**Why This Matters**: The AI works like a dedicated team that never takes breaks. It keeps going until all work is done, updating its memory and learning from each task.

---

## üö® What If Something Goes Wrong?

The AI has built-in safety mechanisms:

**üîß Tool Failures (MCP)**
- AI automatically switches to built-in IDE features
- Work continues without interruption
- You won't even notice most failures

**‚ùå Code Errors**
- AI immediately stops (HALT)
- Automatically fixes the problem using official documentation
- Re-validates until everything is clean
- Only then continues to next task

**üìâ Memory Issues (Context Rot)**
- AI detects when memory files get too large or messy
- Automatically compresses old information
- Keeps important patterns and recent context
- Optimizes for better performance

---

## ‚úÖ What Happens When a Task Completes?

The AI follows this checklist automatically:

1. ‚úì **Implementation Complete** - Code written and working
2. ‚úì **Memory Updated** - All 8 brain files refreshed (plus extras if you have them)
3. ‚úì **Quality Verified** - Zero errors, zero warnings (strict policy)
4. ‚úì **Next Task Loaded** - Already moving to the next item
5. ‚úì **Knowledge Saved** - Patterns stored for future reference

You don't need to check these - the AI does it automatically after every single task.

## üîÑ Starting or Resuming Work (Super Easy)

### **Continuing Existing Projects**

1. Open your project in Windsurf
2. AI automatically scans the `.windsurf/memory-bank/` folder
3. Loads all 8 memory files instantly
4. Type **`next`** or let AI auto-start
5. Work resumes exactly where you left off - no context loss!

### **Starting New Projects**

1. Open your new project folder
2. Type **`init`**
3. AI creates the 8 memory files for you
4. Loads constitutional rules and project structure
5. Ready to work - that's it!

> **Pro Tip**: You literally just type `init` or `next`. The AI handles everything else.

## üìÅ Understanding the File Structure

### **The 8-File Memory System** (Your Project's Brain)

Located at `.windsurf/memory-bank/`, these files remember everything:

1. **activeContext.json** - What's happening right now
2. **scratchpad.json** - Immediate tasks and priorities
3. **kanban.json** - Task board (todo/in-progress/done)
4. **mistakes.json** - Lessons learned from errors
5. **systemPatterns.json** - Successful patterns and decisions
6. **progress.json** - Milestones and metrics
7. **roadmap.json** - Strategic goals and dependencies
8. **memory.json** - Knowledge graph (long-term memory)

**Plus**: `roadmap.md` - Human-readable strategic summary

**Optional Files**: Some projects also have automation files like `blueprint.json`, `deployment.json`, `mermaid.json` - these are extras, not required.

### **The Rules System** (How AI Makes Decisions)

- **Constitution**: `.windsurf/rules/constitution/` - 16 articles defining how AI governs itself
- **Laws**: `.windsurf/rules/laws/` - Technology-specific rules (Rust, Python, Next.js, etc.)
- **Schemas**: `.windsurf/memory-bank/schemas/` - Data structure definitions

### **The Indian Governance Model** (Why This Matters)

The AI operates like India's democratic government:

- **President (Chief Justice)** - Constitutional guardian, final authority
- **Prime Minister (Project Manager)** - Leads execution, coordinates ministers
- **Cabinet Ministers** - Development and Technology ministers implement features
- **Opposition (Shadow Ministers)** - Quality, Innovation, and Analytics experts challenge proposals
- **IAS Officers** - Permanent administrators who maintain project memory and provide expert analysis

**Consensus Required**: 95% agreement needed for major decisions. This prevents bad choices and ensures quality through democratic checks and balances.

## üìñ Need More Details?

- **Quick Start**: You just read it! That's all you need to get started.
- **Technical Details**: See `global_rules.md` for complete framework documentation
- **Constitution**: Read `.windsurf/rules/constitution/` to understand governance in depth

---

**Bottom Line**: Type `init` for new projects or `next` for existing ones. The AI takes care of everything else - continuously, autonomously, and democratically.
