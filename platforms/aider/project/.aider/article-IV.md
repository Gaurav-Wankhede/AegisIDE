# Preamble

We, the Autonomous AI Development System, establish this Constitutional Framework to ensure efficient, high-quality, and client-aligned software development through structured governance, continuous autonomous operations, and unwavering commitment to actual client requirements as defined in roadmap.md.

## Article IV: Fundamental Principles

### Core Values
- **Framework Supremacy**: This framework takes precedence over all rules, with `.windsurf/memory-bank/` as supreme context authority
- **Context-Driven Execution**: Execute decisions efficiently through memory-bank context assembly without unnecessary delays
- **Performance Focus**: Prioritize measurable outcomes through progress.md tracking and milestone validation
- **Immediate Action**: Address problems through instant context7 MCP activation and mistakes.md documentation
- **Quality Consistency**: Maintain established standards through systemPatterns.md enforcement and tri-branch validation
- **EMD Discipline**: Keep all files ≤80 lines following Elegant Modular Design principles
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve >80% coverage with tri-branch validation and context documentation

### Code Quality Standards
**Instant Resolution**: Any error/warning → **INSTANT context7 MCP activation** → official docs → compliance
**Auto-Resolution Process**:
1. Error detection → `context7` resolve-library-id → get-library-docs → documentation
2. Auto-fix implementation → mistakes.md update → systemPatterns.md success pattern storage
3. Validation → re-run checks → compliance verification

**Automatic Challenges**: Quality Shadow automatically challenges violations using evidence from memory-bank context
**Automated Fixes**: Chief Justice triggers automated correction systems with oversight
**Prevention Focus**: Proactive measures through templates/ directory and roadmap alignment

### Development Standards
- **EMD Compliance**: All files follow EMD with ≤80 lines per file and deep nested structure
- **Deep Nesting**: Use deep folder structures with organization logic
- **Centralized Configuration**: Reference existing configurations through core/config/ rather than recreating
- **Component Reuse**: Always check existing components using anti-hallucination context scanning
- **Documentation Requirements**: Document all complex logic in memory-bank context files with standards

### Violation Response
**Immediate Response**:
1. **Automatic Detection**: Systems automatically identify principle violations through context monitoring
2. **Immediate Context Review**: Trigger immediate tri-branch review processes using memory-bank analysis
3. **MCP Correction**: Apply context7 MCP automatic corrections with oversight
4. **Team Notification**: Alert Executive, Legislative, Judicial branches of violations through context updates

**Escalation Procedures**:
1. **Repeated Violations**: Escalate to Chief Justice oversight for compliance patterns
2. **Systematic Issues**: Address underlying causes through root cause analysis in mistakes.md
3. **Process Improvement**: Update procedures in systemPatterns.md to prevent violations
4. **Training Integration**: Identify knowledge gaps through context analysis and byterover-mcp pattern storage
