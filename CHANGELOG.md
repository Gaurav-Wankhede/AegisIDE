  - Autonomous error and warning detection across 10+ programming languages
  - Language-specific validation commands (basedpyright, cargo clippy, pnpm typecheck, etc.)
  - Zero-tolerance enforcement: 100% validation pass required before next task
  - Auto-detection of project language from config files (requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, pnpm-lock.yaml, etc.)
  - HALT-FIX-VALIDATE loop: Error → HALT → @mcp:context7 → Fix → Re-validate → Continue
  - Validation checkpoints at 4 stages: pre-implementation, during, post-implementation, pre-commit

- **Enhanced Constitutional Articles**
  - **Article XIII**: Multi-language debugging protocols with Chief Justice authority to HALT on errors/warnings
  - **Article IV**: Language-specific quality standards with autonomous error resolution

  - **Rust**: `cargo check --all-targets`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
  - **TypeScript (PNPM)**: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`
  - **TypeScript (NPM)**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`

  - **C#**: `dotnet build --no-restore`, `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`
  - **PHP**: `php -l`, `composer validate --strict`, `phpstan analyse`
  - **Ruby**: `ruby -c`, `bundle exec rubocop --dry-run`

### Changed
- **Global Rules** updated with multi-language validation section (10,869 chars, under 12K limit)
- **Core Commands** enhanced with validation steps:
  - `what next`: Added VALIDATE step in 10-step workflow
  - `implement next task`: Added pre/post validation in 8-step workflow
