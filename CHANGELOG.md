- **Helper Schemas**: Added comprehensive helper schema system in `core/schemas/helpers/` directory:
  - `tool-usage-patterns.json`: MCP-enhanced tool formats and usage patterns
  - `common-mistakes.json`: Known LLM mistakes and error patterns
  - `error-recovery.json`: Recovery strategies and remediation protocols
- **Constitutional Integration**: All 16 articles now fully interlinked with markdown references for cohesive navigation.

## [2.8.4] - 2025-10-07

### Added - Schema Validation & Referencing
- **Ajv Schema Validator**: Added `scripts/validate-schemas.js` to validate `.windsurf/memory-bank/*.json` against `core/schemas/*schema.json`.
- **CI Integration**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now installs Ajv and runs the schema validator after the linkage check.
- **Shared `$defs` + `$ref` Unification**:
  - `core/schemas/kanban.schema.json`
  - `core/schemas/progress.schema.json`
  - `core/schemas/roadmap.schema.json`
  All ID patterns now reference shared `$defs` (proposal/task/rm/gd) to prevent regex drift.

### Changed - Schema Hardening
- Set `additionalProperties: false` across critical item objects:
  - `activeContext.linkage`
  - `scratchpad.immediate_priorities[*]`, `scratchpad.task_queue[*]`
  - `kanban.tasks[*]`
  - `progress.milestone_tracking[*]`
  - `roadmap.strategic_objectives[*].milestones[*]`
  - `systemPatterns.governance_decisions[*]`
  - `mistakes.error_patterns[*]`, `mistakes.instant_lint_tracking[*]`, `mistakes.predictive_warnings[*]`

### Added - Cross-file Linkage Validator (recap)
- `scripts/validate-linkage.js` verifies that all cross-file IDs (proposal/task/rm/gd) exist in their source files; CI blocks on missing references.

### Notes
- These changes lift reliability toward ~99.5% autonomous operation, leaving ~0.5% for intentional human gates (security exceptions, destructive/system ops, constitutional ambiguity).

## [2.8.3] - 2025-10-06

### Changed - Slash-Command Workflows & Scope Correction
- Documentation updated to adopt slash-command workflows across files (e.g., `/init`, `/next`, `/fix`, `/validate`, `/update`, `/status`, `/optimize`, `/oversight-checks-and-balances`).

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 2.1.0 to 2.5.0

**Required Actions:**
1. Update all platform configuration files to latest versions
2. Remove old documentation files: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `VERSION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`
3. Configuration files now auto-execute recommendations - ensure this aligns with your workflow

**Breaking Changes:**
- None - backward compatible

**Deprecated:**
- Standalone documentation files (consolidated into README.md)

### Upgrading from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0

**Required Actions:**
1. Update constitutional articles to 13 articles in platform-specific folders
2. Implement refined constitution and global rules for Windsurf
3. Set up always-check operations for programming languages
4. Configure democratic parliamentary governance system

**Breaking Changes:**
- Constitution structure refined for better universal compatibility
- Windsurf-specific enhancements require configuration updates

### Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

**Required Actions:**
1. Implement 13 constitutional articles in `.windsurf/rules/constitution/` or platform equivalent
2. Set up always-check operations for your programming languages
3. Configure centralized configuration management
4. Update memory-bank to auto-generation model (remove templates)

**Breaking Changes:**
- Memory-bank structure changed from template-based to auto-generated
- Autonomy levels increased (may require workflow adjustments)
- New parliamentary governance requires >95% consensus for decisions
