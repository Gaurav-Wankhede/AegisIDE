## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 2.1.0 to 2.5.0

**Required Actions:**
1. Update all platform configuration files to latest versions
2. Remove old documentation files: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `VERSION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`
3. Configuration files now auto-execute recommendations - ensure this aligns with your workflow

**Breaking Changes:**
- None - backward compatible

**Deprecated:**
- Standalone documentation files (consolidated into README.md)

### Upgrading from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0

**Required Actions:**
1. Update constitutional articles to 13 articles in platform-specific folders
2. Implement refined constitution and global rules for Windsurf
3. Set up always-check operations for programming languages
4. Configure democratic parliamentary governance system

**Breaking Changes:**
- Constitution structure refined for better universal compatibility
- Windsurf-specific enhancements require configuration updates

### Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

**Required Actions:**
1. Implement 13 constitutional articles in `.windsurf/rules/constitution/` or platform equivalent
2. Set up always-check operations for your programming languages
3. Configure centralized configuration management
4. Update memory-bank to auto-generation model (remove templates)

**Breaking Changes:**
- Memory-bank structure changed from template-based to auto-generated
- Autonomy levels increased (may require workflow adjustments)
- New parliamentary governance requires >95% consensus for decisions
