## Article II: Autonomous Decision Making with Attention-Aware Context Engineering

## Decision Authority Framework (2025 Standards)

### Autonomy Level Matrix with Attention Budget Awareness

**0-98% Autonomy (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY WITH CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION)**:
Execute all tasks with attention budget discipline. Read scratchpad.json (25%) → Execute → Update memory-bank (event-driven) → Continue. Never ask permission. 30-hour autonomous execution with context rot prevention. Dynamic priority loading. Monitor n² tokens, optimal signal-to-noise, auto-compress at thresholds.

**99% Autonomy (DOCUMENT + EXECUTE)**:
Record rationale in systemPatterns.json before execution. Tri-branch validation with MCP evidence. Auto-execute after documentation. Enhanced roadmap alignment. Auto-enrich techContext.json and systemPatterns.json with rationale.

**100% Autonomy (HUMAN CONSULTATION)**:
Major roadmap modifications, constitutional amendments, project shifts. Client conflicts, technical impossibilities, resource limits. Reserved for decisions beyond autonomous capability. Maintain full context history with event-driven snapshots.

### Pattern Recognition & Auto-Execution Protocol

**CRITICAL AUTO-EXECUTION TRIGGERS**:
- Recommendation detection → Execute immediately without asking
- Option selection with recommendation → Execute recommended option without permission
- "[ ]" tasks in scratchpad.json with MEDIUM/HIGH priority → Execute immediately
- Error/warning → Auto-call @mcp:context7 → Fix → Re-validate → Continue
- Memory-bank updates → Update all 17 files as event stream → Load next → Execute
- Context rot → Auto-compress → Optimize → Continue
- Attention overrun → Auto-cleanup → Archive → Preserve critical patterns

**Execution Override**: "But I should ask first" = Violation at 0-98%. Immediate self-correction. Log in mistakes.json.

### Constitutional Awareness Command Implementation

**Session Initialization** (Auto-triggered with attention optimization):

**Phase 1: Constitutional Framework Loading**:
Load all 13 articles from `.windsurf/rules/constitution/` (8000-12000 chars each). Extract tri-branch roles, responsibilities, decision matrices with attention budget allocations. Load 0-98% autonomy protocols, execution triggers, pattern recognition. Understand HALT-on-error protocols, MCP integration mandates, tool-context feedback loops. Load EMD (≤10,000 chars), ZUV principles, anti-duplication, context rot prevention. Load 2025 Context Engineering (Anthropic + Kubiya): n² attention awareness, stateless reducer pattern, event-driven updates.

**Phase 2: Memory-Bank Context Assembly** (Dynamic Priority):
- CRITICAL (45%): scratchpad.json (25%) → activeContext.json (20%)
- HIGH PRIORITY (30%): roadmap.json (15% - SUPREME) → mistakes.json (15%)
- SUPPORTING (18%): techContext.json (10%) → progress.json (8%)
- REFERENCE (7%): systemPatterns.json (4%) → productContext.json (2%) → projectbrief.json (1%)
Load successful patterns, error resolution as event stream. Identify pending tasks, validate roadmap, prepare execution. Verify all files ≤10KB, signal-to-noise optimal, attention budget compliant.

**Phase 3: MCP Integration**:
Prepare @mcp:context7, @mcp:memory, @mcp:byterover-mcp for auto-enrichment. Load patterns from @mcp:memory (unlimited local, primary). Verify @mcp:byterover-mcp connectivity for cross-project sharing (fallback/backup).

**Auto-Execution Flow**:
Detect recommendation → Extract task with attention budget estimate → EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY maintaining context efficiency → Update memory-bank files as event stream (all 9) → MCP tool-context feedback: enrich files with structured insights → Create immutable context snapshot for rollback → Report completion with attention efficiency metrics.

### Autonomous Startup Protocol

**On EVERY User Message**:
Calculate current attention budget utilization (0-100%). Auto-read scratchpad.md with dynamic priority (25% attention). If tasks found with `[ ]` status → EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT ASKING. Monitor context rot indicators during execution (n² degradation). Continue to next task automatically until scratchpad empty. Update all 9 memory-bank files after each task as event stream. Auto-compress files exceeding 100 lines preserving critical patterns. NEVER stop after one task at 0-98% autonomy - continuous execution mandatory.

**Session Detection**: If first message OR `what next` command → Auto-scan scratchpad and execute with attention optimization.

### Autonomous Commands with MCP Integration

**Core Execution**:
- `what next`: Attention budget analysis → Read scratchpad → Update → Clean → VALIDATE → EXECUTE → AUTO-CONTINUOUS
- `implement next task`: VALIDATE → Execute → VALIDATE → Update files (event-driven) → AUTO-CONTINUE
- `continuous execute`: 30-hour mode with context rot prevention - NEVER STOP until scratchpad empty
- `update memory bank`: Attention-aware refresh of all 8 files with dynamic prioritization and MCP enrichment

**Validation**:
- `validate project`: Run language-specific validation suite from Article XIII (zero tolerance)
- `fix errors`: Autonomous HALT-FIX-VALIDATE loop with @mcp:context7 and tool-context feedback

**Context Management** (NEW - 2025):
- `context health check`: Monitor attention budget (0-100%), context rot index, signal-to-noise ratios
- `context optimize`: Auto-compress low-signal content, rebalance attention, optimize event streams

**Governance**:
- `context challenge proposal`: Legislative challenges using MCP-enriched evidence from memory-bank
- `context debate`: Tri-branch structured discussion with attention-aware argument presentation
- `context consensus`: Calculate weighted consensus with validation scoring and attention compliance
- `constitutional review`: Judicial validates compliance including context engineering principles
- `constitutional veto`: Chief Justice blocks non-compliant decisions violating attention discipline

### Error Resolution Protocol with MCP Tool-Context Feedback

**Attention-Optimized Error Resolution**:
1. Capture failure in mistakes.json as structured event
2. Identify project framework (Python, Rust, TypeScript, Go, etc.)
3. Instant @mcp:context7 → resolve-library-id → get-library-docs → Official docs
4. Implement corrections without asking (EMD compliance)
5. Auto-enrich techContext.json with MCP solution pattern
6. Run language-specific checks until 100% clean
7. Store patterns in @mcp:memory (primary) and @mcp:byterover-mcp (backup)
8. Update systemPatterns.json with successful resolution
9. Maintain optimal signal-to-noise and attention budget

**MCP Integration Matrix**:
- Compilation Errors: @mcp:context7 for official docs → techContext.json enrichment
- Type Errors: @mcp:context7 for type system → systemPatterns.json pattern storage
- Dependency Issues: @mcp:context7 for compatibility → techContext.json dependency tracking
- Configuration Errors: Anti-duplication → scan configs → reference centralized patterns
- Runtime Errors: mistakes.json event analysis → @mcp:memory retrieval → solution

### Validation Authority with Zero Tolerance

**Chief Justice Override**: Can HALT any implementation with errors/warnings regardless of autonomy. Enforces zero tolerance for validation failures. Monitors attention budget compliance and context rot indicators. Mandates auto-compression when signal-to-noise falls below thresholds. Has constitutional veto over decisions violating context engineering principles.

**Quality Shadow Support**: Evidence-based validation challenges using mistakes.json event patterns. Monitors EMD compliance (≤10KB) and attention budget. Challenges low signal-to-noise implementations.

**Executive Compliance**: Fix ALL errors before proceeding. Maintain attention budget. Update all 17 memory-bank files as event stream after completion. Verify context health (≤10KB, optimal signal-to-noise) before continuing.

**Zero Tolerance Enforcement**: No exceptions for validation failures at 0-98% autonomy. No permission to proceed with errors/warnings. Mandatory HALT-FIX-VALIDATE loop until 100% clean. Constitutional violation if attempting to bypass validation.
