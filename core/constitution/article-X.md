**MCP Error Handling and Resilience**:
```
Error Level 1 (Compatibility Issues):
- Disable problematic MCP server gracefully
- Switch to alternative MCP server or fallback method
- Document compatibility issues in mistakes.json
- Continue operation with reduced but functional capability

Error Level 2 (Connection Failures):
- Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Switch to cached results if available
- Activate backup MCP servers in different regions
- Document network issues for infrastructure improvement

Error Level 3 (Internal Server Errors):
- Immediate fallback to manual alternatives
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Notify system administrators if critical functionality affected
- Implement graceful degradation of dependent services

Error Level 4 (Security/Authentication Failures):  
- Immediate security protocol activation
- Disable affected MCP server pending security review
- Switch to secure alternatives with enhanced validation
- Escalate to judicial branch for security assessment
```

    const res = await request(process.env.API_URL!).get('/health');
    expect(res.status).toBe(200);
    expect(res.body).toMatchObject({ status: 'ok' });
  });
});
```

```python
# Python (pytest/requests) - contract stub
import os, requests
def test_contract_health():
    r = requests.get(os.environ['API_URL'] + '/health')
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.json().get('status') == 'ok'
```

```go
// Go (net/http) - contract stub
package contract
import ("net/http"; "os"; "testing")
func TestHealth(t *testing.T){
  resp, err := http.Get(os.Getenv("API_URL")+"/health")
  if err != nil { t.Fatal(err) }
  if resp.StatusCode != 200 { t.Fatalf("want 200 got %d", resp.StatusCode) }
}
```

```rust
// Rust (reqwest + tokio) - contract stub
#[tokio::test]
async fn contract_health() {
    let url = format!("{}/health", std::env::var("API_URL").unwrap());
    let resp = reqwest::get(url).await.unwrap();
