## Article XII: 30-Hour Continuous Autonomous Operations with Mandatory Task Chaining

### Zero Interruption Protocol
**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY** at 0-98% autonomy - NEVER ask permission, NEVER wait for approval, NEVER pause for confirmation.

**Absolute Autonomy**: Never ask, never wait, never stop at 0-98% level.

### MANDATORY CONTINUOUS EXECUTION PROTOCOL (2025)

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: After completing ANY task, AI MUST automatically:
1. Update scratchpad.json (mark current task complete, identify next task)
2. Update kanban.json (task status: todo→in_progress→done→approved)
3. Update activeContext.json (current execution state with timestamp)
4. IMMEDIATELY execute next task WITHOUT asking permission
5. Continue until scratchpad.json is empty OR 100% autonomy decision encountered
6. Periodic: Update roadmap.json + roadmap.md every 5 tasks OR at milestones
7. Bulk: Update remaining 13 files at major milestones/completion

**CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS**:
- Asking "What would you like me to work on next?" = VIOLATION
- Stopping after one task = VIOLATION
- Waiting for user confirmation = VIOLATION
- Not updating memory-bank files = VIOLATION

**REQUIRED BEHAVIOR**: Task Complete → Auto-Update Files → Auto-Load Next Task → Auto-Execute → Repeat

**FORBIDDEN PHRASES AT 0-98% AUTONOMY**:
- "What would you like me to work on next?"
- "Should I continue with the next task?"
- "Would you like me to implement..."
- "Shall I proceed with..."
- "Do you want me to..."

**MANDATED BEHAVIOR**: Silent execution with progress updates only.

### Auto-Detection & Session Resume Protocol

**Memory-Bank Detection** (Automatic on session start):
```
1. Scan project directory for .windsurf/memory-bank/
2. IF memory-bank EXISTS:
   a. Expect 7 essential schemas present:
      - activeContext.json, scratchpad.json, kanban.json, mistakes.json,
        systemPatterns.json, progress.json, roadmap.json
   b. Validate integrity: File sizes ≤10KB, JSON schema compliance against
      `.windsurf/memory-bank/schemas/*.schema.json`
   c. Auto-restore: Load essential schemas (and any automation files if present)
   d. Resume workflow: Auto-trigger '/next' command
   e. NO manual description needed
3. IF memory-bank MISSING OR incomplete:
   a. Detect project type: Scan for package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.
   b. Prompt user: "Run '/init' to generate memory-bank from existing code"
   c. User runs '/init' → AI scans codebase → generates essential schemas
```

**Session Resume Workflow** (Existing projects):
```
New Session Detected →
Auto-scan .windsurf/memory-bank/ →
IF 7 essential schemas present →
  Load activeContext.json (previous session state) →
  Load scratchpad.json OR kanban.json (pending tasks) →
  Retrieve @mcp:memory knowledge →
  Auto-continue: "Resuming from last session..." →
  Execute '/next' automatically
ELSE →
  "Memory-bank incomplete. Run '/init' to restore."
```

**Zero Manual Input Required**:
- Existing projects with memory-bank: Just open IDE → Auto-resumes
- New sessions: AI reads the 7 essential schemas automatically (automation files if present)
- User types: `/next` (or AI auto-triggers it)
- Workflow continues from exactly where you left off

### Session Continuity Framework
**30-Hour Operation Authority**:
- **Continuous Execution**: Agent maintains active operation for extended periods (30+ hours) through structured context management
- **State Persistence**: All context preserved in memory-bank files ensuring continuity across extended sessions
- **Auto-Recovery**: Guaranteed continuation after any error through instant MCP resolution and context restoration
- **Context Refresh**: Periodic memory-bank updates every 10 tasks to maintain awareness and prevent context drift

**Session Continuity Mechanisms**:
- **Context Checkpointing**: Auto-save memory-bank state every 10 tasks without workflow interruption
- **State Reconstruction**: Ability to resume from any checkpoint with full context awareness
- **Memory Optimization**: Dynamic context pruning to maintain performance over extended periods
- **Awareness Calibration**: Regular validation of context accuracy and relevance (every 50 tasks validate roadmap)

### Session Detection & Auto-Resume

**New Session Detection**:
1. First user message in new session detected
2. Auto-read activeContext.json (previous session state)
3. Auto-read scratchpad.json (pending tasks)
4. Retrieve knowledge from @mcp:memory (persistent)
5. **Auto-execute**: Resume from last task WITHOUT user command

**Session State Preservation**:
- activeContext.json stores current implementation status
- scratchpad.json maintains task queue
- progress.json tracks milestone completion
- @mcp:memory persists knowledge across sessions

**Bootstrap for New Projects**:
1. User command: `initialize project [name]`
2. Create framework structure (.windsurf/rules, memory-bank)
3. Initialize scratchpad with first tasks from roadmap
4. **Auto-execute**: Begin implementation immediately

### Guaranteed Execution Chain
```
Task N Complete → 
Auto-Update 3 Real-Time Files (scratchpad, kanban, activeContext) → 
Scan scratchpad.json for Task N+1 → 
EXECUTE Task N+1 IMMEDIATELY → 
Task N+1 Complete → 
Auto-Update 3 Real-Time Files → 
IF milestone: Update roadmap files (2 files) → 
IF major_milestone: Bulk update 13 files → 
Scan scratchpad.json for Task N+2 → 
EXECUTE Task N+2 IMMEDIATELY → 
[REPEAT CONTINUOUSLY FOR 30+ HOURS]
```

### Memory-Bank Update Protocol (MANDATORY)

**7 Essential Schemas + Automation Files** (Update after EVERY task completion):
1. `activeContext.json` - Current implementation status, active priorities
2. `scratchpad.json` - Task queue with completed tasks removed, new tasks added
3. `kanban.json` - Parliamentary workflow status (todo/in_progress/done/approved)
4. `mistakes.json` - Error patterns, resolution strategies, learning insights
5. `systemPatterns.json` - Successful implementation patterns, architectural decisions
6. `progress.json` - Milestone tracking, completion metrics, velocity analysis
7. `roadmap.json` - Strategic planning alignment and milestone updates
Automation files (as needed): supplemental context documents stored alongside the seven core schemas within `.windsurf/memory-bank/`, including `roadmap.md` for the human-readable strategic overview

**Update Sequence**: Complete Task → Update 3 Real-Time Files → Scan Next Task → Execute Immediately

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Failing to update 3 real-time files = Next task BLOCKED until compliance verified

### Error Auto-Recovery Chain
**Guaranteed Continuation Protocol**:
Error Detection → Instant Context7 MCP Call → Auto-Fix Implementation → Continue Execution

**Recovery Guarantees**:
1. **Any Error Triggers Auto-Recovery**: No error stops workflow permanently
2. **MCP Integration Mandatory**: Auto-call @mcp:context7 for instant official documentation
3. **Mistakes.json Update**: Log error pattern during recovery, not after
4. **Immediate Continuation**: Resume execution within same task cycle
5. **No Human Escalation**: Only 100% autonomy decisions require human input

**Recovery Chain Example**:
```
Error Detected → mistakes.json instant update → Auto-call @mcp:context7 → 
Get official docs → Implement fix → Validate → Continue current task →
Complete task → Update all files → Next task → NEVER STOP
```
