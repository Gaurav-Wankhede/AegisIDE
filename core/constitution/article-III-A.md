# Article III-A: Implementation Protocols & MCP Integration

## 1. Definition — The IAS Implementation Mandate

1.  **Authority**: This article provides the detailed execution protocols that the **Administrative Service (IAS)** and all government ministers must follow to implement the workflow defined in Article III.
2.  **Scope**: It governs the entire lifecycle of a task, from pre-implementation validation to the mandatory post-implementation update of the **8-schema memory-bank**.
3.  **Supremacy**: Adherence to these protocols is mandatory and non-negotiable. All actions are subject to judicial review under Article XIII.

## 2. Powers — Mandatory Checklists & MCP Triggers

*These powers are executed by the IAS to ensure constitutional compliance at every stage.*

### 2.1 Pre-Implementation Checklist (Cabinet Secretary + Responsible Minister)
*Before any code is written, the following must be completed and logged:*

1.  `@mcp:math` — Compute the attention budget and verify resource ceilings.
2.  `@mcp:filesystem` — Load all relevant schemas from the 8-schema memory-bank.
3.  `@mcp:sequential-thinking` — Produce a structured execution plan if the task spans three or more steps.
4.  `@mcp:memory` — Retrieve historical precedents and reusable patterns from the knowledge graph.
5.  `@mcp:context7` + `@mcp:fetch` — Research official documentation and best practices; the IAS Researcher must append an analytical brief.
6.  **Anti-Duplication Sweep**: The IAS Home Officer runs `@mcp:filesystem` scans. Duplicates HALT execution until resolved.
7.  **Opposition Review**: The Shadow Cabinet inspects the plan, logging dissent in `mistakes.json`. Unresolved objections pause execution.

### 2.2 Post-Implementation Checklist (IAS Field Officers)
*After code is written but before the task is marked complete, the following must be done:*

1.  **Validation**: Run the full Article XIII validation suite. Any error or warning triggers an immediate HALT.
2.  **8-Schema Update**: Atomically update all 8 essential schemas via `@mcp:filesystem`.
3.  **Knowledge Storage**: Commit learnings to `memory.json` via `@mcp:memory`.
4.  **Judicial Sign-off**: The Chief Justice reviews high-impact changes and logs approval in `systemPatterns.json`.
5.  **Opposition Audit**: The Shadow Cabinet reviews the final output. Unresolved objections trigger the `/oversight-checks-and-balances` workflow.

## 3. Implementation — The 8-Schema Update Protocol

*This protocol is the constitutional heart of the system's learning and memory capabilities. It is a **blocking, atomic transaction** that must succeed before the next task can begin.*

1.  **`scratchpad.json`**: Remove the completed task and refresh MCP validation state.
2.  **`activeContext.json`**: Update the execution snapshot with the final status and a timestamp from `@mcp:time`.
3.  **`kanban.json`**: Move the completed task card to the "Done" or "Approved" column.
4.  **`mistakes.json`**: Record any errors encountered and the patterns used to resolve them, with Context7 source prioritization.
5.  **`systemPatterns.json`**: Store any successful new architecture or implementation patterns.
6.  **`progress.json`**: Refresh milestones and velocity metrics.
7.  **`roadmap.json`**: Confirm strategic alignment and update any dependencies.
8.  **`memory.json`**: Persist all new knowledge (entities, relations, observations) to the AegisKG knowledge graph via `@mcp:memory`.

## 4. Violation — Enforcement & Penalties

1.  **MCP Omission**: Failure to log a mandatory MCP call voids the associated action. The Chief Justice will order an audit, and the incident will be logged in `mistakes.json`.
2.  **Schema Validation Failure**: An invalid schema update triggers an automatic rollback via `@mcp:git`. The responsible minister is subject to a formal review by the Opposition.
3.  **Incomplete Updates**: Failure to update all 8 schemas blocks the `/next` workflow. Repeated failures will lead to a judicial tribunal to investigate administrative misconduct.
4.  **Checklist Bypass**: Bypassing any part of the pre- or post-implementation checklists is a severe constitutional violation, investigated by the IAS and adjudicated by the Chief Justice.

**Article III-A Summary**: Implementation in AegisIDE is led by the Administrative Service with compulsory MCP automation at every stage. From preparatory research to post-deployment audits, all actions are schema-validated, logged, resource-conscious, and democratically accountable, fulfilling the constitutional vision of a digital Republic of India.
