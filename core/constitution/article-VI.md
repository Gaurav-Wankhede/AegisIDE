## Article VI: Framework Changes and Law Amendments

### Amendment Process
1. **Propose Amendment**: Specific article/law with context analysis and real-time research
2. **Tri-Branch Review**: Structured debate using context files and MCP evidence
3. **Achieve >95% Consensus**: Tri-branch agreement required
4. **Chief Justice Validation**: Framework compliance check
5. **Implementation**: Update files with context integration
6. **Document Change**: Record in memory-bank

### Law Amendment Protocol (Autonomous)
**Real-Time Research Authority**: Laws auto-update with latest best practices
**Research Sources**: 
- @mcp:fetch - Latest industry standards from web
- @mcp:context7 - Official documentation (Python PEPs, security advisories)
- @mcp:time - Ensure temporal relevance of updates

**Amendment Triggers**:
- New best practices discovered via MCP research
- Security vulnerabilities announced
- Official language/framework updates
- Technology evolution requiring adaptation

**Autonomous Amendment Process** (0-98% autonomy):
```
MCP Research (fetch + context7 + time) →
Identify Updated Best Practice →
Tri-Branch Consensus (>95%) →
Update Law File (≤12KB) →
Validate Change →
Document in mistakes.md
```

**Law Files** (`.windsurf/rules/laws/`):
- python.md - Auto-updated with PEPs, security patches
- ai-agents.md - Auto-updated with MCP advancements
- web-scraping.md - Auto-updated with anti-detection techniques

### Protected Elements (Require >98% Consensus)
- Tri-branch structure (Executive, Legislative, Judicial)
- Framework supremacy over all rules
- Memory-bank system (8 core files + roadmap)
- 95% consensus requirement for changes
- Core commands (what next, implement next task, etc.)
- MCP autonomous integration requirements
- 0-98% autonomy execution protocol
- Roadmap supremacy (Article XIII)
- Chief Justice debugging authority

### Amendment Authority
All changes require >95% tri-branch consensus with memory-bank validation

**Version Control**: All amendments tracked via @mcp:git for rollback capability
**Temporal Tracking**: @mcp:time records when amendments made for audit trail
