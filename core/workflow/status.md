# /status - 7-Schema Status Report

## Purpose
Provide comprehensive overview of project status by analyzing all 7 essential schemas, tasks, progress, and constitutional compliance with AegisKG integration.

## Constitutional Authority
- **Article II**: Autonomous Decision Making - Status monitoring
- **Article VII**: Autonomous Operations - System health diagnostics
- **Article XI**: Accountability and Transparency - Status reporting

## Workflow Sequence

### Phase 1: 7-Schema Health Check (JSON Awareness)
```bash
# Scan 7 essential schemas with attention allocation:
@mcp:filesystem → Read and analyze with priority:
- scratchpad.json (30% attention - immediate priorities with MCP validation)
- activeContext.json (25% attention - real-time execution state with session management)
- kanban.json (15% attention - task workflow and parliamentary approval)
- mistakes.json (15% attention - error patterns with Context7 source prioritization)
- systemPatterns.json (7% attention - architecture patterns with AegisKG networks)
- progress.json (5% attention - milestones with constitutional metrics)
- roadmap.json (3% attention - strategic planning)

# Calculate health metrics with 59% optimization:
@mcp:math → Analyze:
- File sizes (≤10KB compliance for 2.6x faster parsing)
- Schema validation against `.windsurf/memory-bank/schemas/`
- AegisKG knowledge graph integration status
- Memory-bank sync health
- Context7 source prioritization accuracy
- Attention budget efficiency (59% optimization achieved)
```

### Phase 2: Task Status Analysis (7-Schema)
```bash
# Analyze task states from scratchpad.json:
- Total pending tasks with MCP validation state
- Priority distribution (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Blocked tasks with dependencies
- Estimated completion time
- AegisKG pattern matching for similar tasks

# Cross-reference with progress.json:
- Milestone completion percentage
- Constitutional compliance metrics
- AegisKG progress correlation
- Performance tracking indicators
- Done count
- Approved count
- Task velocity (tasks/day)
- Average completion time
```

### Phase 3: Progress Metrics
```bash
# Calculate progress:

From progress.json:
- Milestones completed
- Milestones in progress
- Milestones pending
- Overall completion percentage
- Velocity trends
- Performance metrics

From roadmap.json:
- Strategic objectives status
- Business value delivered
- Client requirements met
- Roadmap alignment score (≥95%)

@mcp:math → Calculate:
- Project completion: X%
- Sprint velocity: Y tasks/week
- Quality score: Z%
- Efficiency rating: A/B/C
```

### Phase 4: Constitutional Compliance (Constitution Awareness)
```bash
# Verify compliance:

Constitutional adherence:
- Framework compliance: ≥80% required
- Democratic consensus: >95% achieved
- Memory bank integrity: Valid/Invalid (6 essential schemas)
- MCP integration: Operational/Degraded

Code quality:
- EMD compliance: Files ≤80 lines
- ZUV principle: Variables used meaningfully
- Validation status: Pass/Fail
- Test coverage: X%

Attention budget:
- Current allocation: X%
- Optimal distribution: Yes/No
- Context rot detected: Yes/No
- Signal-to-noise ratio: X%
```

### Phase 5: Error & Warning Analysis
```bash
# Analyze issues:

From mistakes.json:
- Total errors encountered
- Error patterns identified
- Resolution success rate
- Prevention strategies applied
- Learning integration status

Current validation status:
- Compilation errors: X
- Type errors: Y
- Linting warnings: Z
- Security issues: A
- Performance issues: B

# Zero tolerance check:
IF any errors/warnings:
  → Status: BLOCKED
  → Action: /fix required
ELSE:
  → Status: HEALTHY
  → Action: Continue /next
```

### Phase 6: Resource Utilization (MCP Awareness)
```bash
# Analyze resource usage:

Memory bank:
- Total size: X KB / 70 KB target (7 files × ≤10KB)
- Largest file: Y KB
- Files needing compression: Z
- Schema compliance: X%

Git repository:
- Total commits: X
- Branches: Y
- Last commit: Z hours ago
- Uncommitted changes: A files

MCP integration:
- @mcp:filesystem: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:context7: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:byterover-mcp: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:memory: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:sequential-thinking: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:git: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:fetch: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:time: Operational/Failed
- @mcp:math: Operational/Failed

Overall MCP health: X/9 operational
```

### Phase 7: Status Report Generation
```bash
# Generate comprehensive report:
