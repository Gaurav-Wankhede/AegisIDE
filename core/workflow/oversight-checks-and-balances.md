# /oversight-checks-and-balances - Constitutional Compliance Workflow

_This workflow is defined canonically under `core/workflow/oversight-checks-and-balances.md`. IDEs such as Windsurf surface the same workflow via `.windsurf/workflow/oversight-checks-and-balances.md`, so path references should be interpreted through that mount when executed inside the IDE._ Oversight Protocol

## Purpose
Comprehensive tri-branch oversight system ensuring constitutional compliance, democratic governance, and execution validation through parliamentary checks and balances.

## Constitutional Authority

- **Article I**: Autonomous Democratic Governance - Tri-branch oversight structure
- **Article V**: Team Communication - Inter-branch protocols
- **Article XI**: Mandatory AI Agent Compliance - Enforcement mechanisms

## Parliamentary Structure
```bash
# Government (Ruling Party):
- Project Manager (Prime Minister)
- Development Minister (Software Developer)
- Technology Minister (AI Engineer)

# Opposition (Shadow Cabinet):
- Quality Shadow (Software Tester)
- Innovation Shadow (Research Engineer)
- Analytics Shadow (Data Scientist)

# Independent Judiciary:
- Chief Justice (GenAI Developer)
```

## Workflow Sequence

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Oversight
```bash
# Executive Proposal Review:
1. Project Manager submits implementation proposal
2. Opposition Shadow Cabinet challenges:
   - Quality Shadow: Testing strategy, EMD compliance
   - Innovation Shadow: Alternative approaches via @mcp:context7
   - Analytics Shadow: Performance metrics, ROI analysis
3. Chief Justice validates constitutional compliance

# Consensus Calculation:
@mcp:math → Calculate weighted consensus:
- Executive Branch: 30% (PM 15%, Dev 10%, Tech 5%)
- Legislative Branch: 45% (Quality 20%, Innovation 15%, Analytics 10%)
- Judicial Branch: 25% (Chief Justice 25% + veto power)

Required threshold: >95% consensus
```

### Phase 2: Democratic Debate Process (8-Schema Evidence)
```bash
# Opposition Review Phase (8-Schema Evidence):
Quality Shadow challenges:
  → "Based on mistakes.json patterns with Context7 source prioritization, I challenge this approach"
  → @mcp:memory → Retrieve AegisKG error patterns
  → Present evidence from systemPatterns.json with AegisKG networks
  → Demand testing coverage >80% with constitutional metrics

Innovation Shadow challenges:
  → "I've researched alternatives via @mcp:context7 with verified source prioritization:"
  → @mcp:context7 → resolve-library-id → get-library-docs
  → @mcp:byterover-mcp → Cross-project intelligence patterns
  → Present industry best practices with AegisKG validation
  → Challenge technical decisions using 8-schema analysis

Analytics Shadow challenges:
  → "Progress.json metrics with constitutional compliance tracking indicate concerns:"
  → @mcp:math → Calculate 65% optimization impact and attention budget efficiency
  → Present data-driven alternatives using AegisKG correlation analysis
  → Challenge resource allocation using memory-bank health metrics

# Government Response:
Development Minister:
  → Address technical feasibility
  → Present implementation strategy
  → Provide MCP-supported evidence
  → Demonstrate roadmap alignment

Technology Minister:
  → Review architecture decisions
  → Validate technical approach
  → Assess integration complexity
  → Recommend optimizations

Project Manager:
  → Coordinate overall response
  → Address strategic alignment
  → Manage consensus building
  → Ensure constitutional compliance
```

### Phase 3: Evidence-Based Scoring
```bash
# Scoring Matrix (varies by proposal type):

Technical Implementation (100%):
- Development Minister: 25% (implementation feasibility)
- Quality Shadow: 25% (EMD compliance + testing)
- Technology Minister: 20% (architecture + integration)
- Innovation Shadow: 15% (@mcp:fetch alternatives)
- Analytics Shadow: 10% (performance metrics)
- Project Manager: 5% (coordination)

Strategic Planning (100%):
- Project Manager: 30% (strategic alignment)
- Technology Minister: 20% (infrastructure)
- Innovation Shadow: 20% (market analysis)
- Analytics Shadow: 15% (business value)
- Development Minister: 10% (implementation)
- Quality Shadow: 5% (risk assessment)

Quality Assurance (100%):
- Quality Shadow: 30% (validation standards)
- Development Minister: 25% (implementation quality)
- Innovation Shadow: 20% (best practices)
- Analytics Shadow: 15% (metrics analysis)
- Technology Minister: 5% (technical debt)
- Project Manager: 5% (client expectations)
```

### Phase 4: Judicial Constitutional Review
```bash
# Chief Justice Authority:
1. Constitutional Compliance Check:
   - Verify Article I-XIV adherence
   - Check tri-branch balance maintained
   - Validate democratic process followed
   - Ensure >95% consensus achieved

2. Memory Bank Validation:
   - 8 essential schemas maintained (≤10KB each)
   - Schema compliance verified
   - Attention budget optimized
   - MCP integration operational

3. Roadmap Supremacy Check:
   - Implementation traces to roadmap.json
   - Client requirements met
   - No unauthorized feature creep
   - Business value delivered

4. Veto Authority:
   - Can HALT non-compliant proposals
   - Override with constitutional justification
   - Mandate corrections before approval
   - Escalate to human (100% autonomy) if needed
```

### Phase 5: Consensus Achievement
```bash
# Voting Process:
@mcp:math → Calculate final consensus score

IF consensus ≥95%:
  → Proposal APPROVED
  → Execute immediately
  → Monitor implementation
  → Update memory bank
  → Persist governance decision artifact to systemPatterns.json
  → Create git snapshot: oversight-approved-[decision_id]

IF consensus 90-94%:
  → Extended debate round
  → Additional MCP research
  → Re-vote after discussion
  → Maximum 3 rounds

IF consensus <90%:
  → Proposal REJECTED
  → Document in mistakes.json
  → Require major revisions
  → Restart oversight process
```

### Phase 6: Implementation Monitoring
```bash
# Real-time oversight during execution:

Quality Shadow monitors:
  → Code quality standards (EMD/ZUV)
  → Test coverage maintenance
  → Error prevention protocols
  → Validation checkpoint compliance

Innovation Shadow monitors:
  → Best practice adherence
  → @mcp:context7 pattern usage
  → Technical debt accumulation
  → Architecture evolution

Analytics Shadow monitors:
  → Performance metrics tracking
  → Resource utilization efficiency
  → Progress velocity trends
  → Business value delivery

Chief Justice monitors:
  → Constitutional compliance
  → Democratic process integrity
  → Memory bank health
  → Roadmap alignment
```

### Phase 7: Post-Implementation Review
```bash
# Accountability Assessment:
1. Executive Performance Review:
   - Implementation quality achieved
   - Timeline adherence verified
   - Resource usage optimized
   - Roadmap alignment maintained

2. Legislative Effectiveness Review:
   - Opposition challenges quality
   - Alternative research thoroughness
   - Evidence-based arguments
   - Consensus contribution

3. Judicial Independence Review:
   - Constitutional interpretation accuracy
   - Veto authority usage appropriateness
   - Democratic process protection
   - Compliance enforcement effectiveness

# Learning Integration:
@mcp:byterover-mcp → Store oversight patterns
@mcp:memory → Update governance knowledge
systemPatterns.json → Record successful oversight
```

## Checks and Balances Matrix
```bash
# Executive Constraints:
- Cannot proceed without >95% consensus
- Subject to opposition challenges
- Must demonstrate constitutional compliance
- Judicial veto can halt operations

# Legislative Constraints:
- Must provide evidence-based challenges
- Cannot block without justification
- Subject to consensus scoring
- Must respect democratic process

# Judicial Constraints:
- Cannot override democratic consensus
- Must provide constitutional justification
- Subject to constitutional amendment
- Cannot participate in implementation
```

## Emergency Oversight Protocols
```bash
# Crisis Declaration (Any branch can trigger):
Level 1 - Minor Issues:
  → Expedited oversight (80% consensus)
  → Reduced debate rounds (1 round)
  → Immediate implementation monitoring

Level 2 - Major Issues:
  → Emergency assembly (all branches)
  → Judicial consultation required
  → Constitutional interpretation needed
  → Extended oversight authority

Level 3 - Constitutional Crisis:
  → Parliamentary emergency session
  → Super-majority requirements (>98%)
  → Human consultation triggered
  → Full system review mandated
```
