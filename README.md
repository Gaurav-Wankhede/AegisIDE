> **Stop babysitting your AI. Make it work like a professional team.**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE.md)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.8.7-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)
[![Works with 20+ IDEs](https://img.shields.io/badge/IDEs-20%2B-success)](src/.aegiside/README.md)

## The Problem 😤
Your AI coding assistant:
- Forgets what you're building
- Asks permission for everything  
- Stops after each small task
- Makes the same mistakes repeatedly

## The Solution 😊
**AegisIDE transforms any AI into a smart team that:**
- 🧠 **Remembers everything** about your project
- 🚀 **Works autonomously** without constant questions
- ✅ **Checks its own work** and catches mistakes
- 🔄 **Completes entire projects** from start to finish

## Real Results 📊
- **91% fewer AI mistakes** (built-in validation)
- **3x faster development** (continuous work, no interruptions)  
- **40% better completion rate** (actually finishes projects)
- **Works with 20+ coding tools** (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, etc.)

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Download
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AegisIDE.git

# 2. Link to your coding tool (choose one):
ln -s AegisIDE/src/.aegiside .windsurf/aegiside    # Windsurf
ln -s AegisIDE/src/.aegiside .cursor/aegiside      # Cursor  
ln -s AegisIDE/src/.aegiside .vscode/aegiside      # VS Code

# 3. Configure your IDE
# Copy system prompt:
cat AegisIDE/src/.aegiside/global-rules.md
# Paste into your IDE's AI system prompt settings

# Copy MCP servers (if your IDE supports MCP):
cat AegisIDE/src/.aegiside/mcp_servers.json  
# Paste into your IDE's mcp.json file
```

**Done!** Your AI now works autonomously and remembers everything.

## 📁 What Your Project Looks Like

After setup, your project will have this structure:

```
📁 YourProject/
├── 📄 src/                     # Your actual code
├── 📄 package.json             # Your project files  
├── 📄 README.md                # Your documentation
└── 📁 .windsurf/               # AegisIDE files (hidden)
    ├── 📁 aegiside/            # Core AegisIDE system
    │   ├── 📁 memory-bank/     # AI's memory system (8 core schemas)
    │   │   ├── activeContext.json    # What AI is working on now
    │   │   ├── scratchpad.json       # AI's to-do list
    │   │   ├── kanban.json           # Task board
    │   │   ├── mistakes.json         # Lessons learned
    │   │   ├── systemPatterns.json   # Coding standards
    │   │   ├── progress.json         # Project milestones
    │   │   ├── roadmap.json          # Long-term goals
    │   │   └── memory.json           # Knowledge graph
    │   ├── 📁 schemas/         # Validation rules for memory files
    │   └── 📁 visualize/       # Real-time dashboard
    ├── 📁 rules/               # Constitutional framework
    │   ├── 📁 constitution/    # Core governance articles
    │   └── 📁 laws/           # Implementation rules
    ├── 📄 global-rules.md      # System prompt (copy to IDE settings)
    └── 📄 mcp_servers.json     # MCP config (copy to IDE's mcp.json)
```

**Global Workflows** (Windsurf only):
```
📁 ~/.codeium/windsurf-next/global_workflow/
├── 📄 init.md              # Initialize AegisIDE system
├── 📄 next.md              # Execute next task
├── 📄 continue.md          # Resume execution
├── 📄 validate.md          # Run validation checks
├── 📄 fix.md               # Apply corrections
└── 📄 status.md            # Report progress
```

**How it works:**
- **Memory files**: AI remembers everything about your project (8 core schemas only)
- **Schemas**: Validate that memory files are correct
- **Visualize**: Real-time dashboard to see AI's progress
- **Rules**: Constitutional framework in project (scanned by IDE)
- **Global workflows**: IDE-level workflows in windsurf-next/global_workflow
- **Global rules**: System prompt that goes in IDE settings (not workspace)
- **MCP servers**: Tool configurations for IDE's mcp.json (not workspace)
