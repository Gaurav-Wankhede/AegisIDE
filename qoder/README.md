This folder adapts the Constitutional Framework for Agentic IDE to Qoder with **democratic parliamentary governance** and **96% autonomous capability**.

## Democratic Architecture
- **Constitution**: `.qoder/rules/constitution.md` - Supreme law with 11 articles defining democratic parliamentary structure
- **Executive**: `global_rules.md` - Operational implementation under constitutional authority  
- **Memory Bank**: Intelligence management with constitutional compliance tracking
- **Oversight**: `workflows/oversight-checks-and-balances.md` - Parliamentary checks and balances

## Parliamentary Structure
**Government (Ruling Party)**:
- PM(Project Manager) - Strategic leadership, policy proposals
- Dev Minister(Software Developer) - Technical implementations  
- Tech Minister(AI Engineer) - innovation strategy, automation

**Opposition (Shadow Cabinet)**:
- Quality Shadow(Software Tester) - Quality challenges, testing validation
- Innovation Shadow(Research Engineer) - Research-based alternatives
- Analytics Shadow(Data Scientist) - Data-driven evidence, empirical opposition

**Independent Judiciary**:
- Chief Justice(GenAI Developer) - Constitutional compliance review, democratic process enforcement

## How Democratic Governance Works
- **Parliamentary Procedure**: Proposal→Opposition Review→Debate→Evidence Scoring→>95% Consensus→Judicial Review→Implementation
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Never proceed without constitutional compliance ≥80 AND democratic consensus ≥95%
- **Decision Matrix**: 0-30(Auto), 31-60(Document), 61-80(Validate), 81-100(Consult)
- **MCP Integration**: context7(docs), fetch(info), git(control), memory(persistence), byterover(knowledge) with constitutional validation

## Democratic Workflow Commands
 
| Command | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| "propose-change <proposal>" | Government | Submit proposal for parliamentary review |
| "challenge-proposal <proposal>" | Opposition | Evidence-based challenges and alternatives |
| "conduct-debate <topic>" | Parliament | Structured debate with evidence scoring |
| "calculate-consensus <proposal>" | Parliament | Expertise-weighted voting (Technical/Strategic/Quality) |
| "judicial-review <decision>" | Chief Justice | Constitutional compliance review |
| "run pre-oversight" | Parliament | Constitutional scan + democratic impact assessment |
| "run post-oversight" | Parliament | Execution audit with accountability review |

## Consensus Scoring Matrix
**Technical Proposals**: Dev(25%), Test(25%), AI(20%), Research(15%), Data(10%), PM(5%)
**Strategic Proposals**: PM(30%), AI(20%), Research(20%), Data(15%), Dev(10%), Test(5%)  
**Quality Proposals**: Test(30%), Dev(25%), Research(20%), Data(15%), AI(5%), PM(5%)

## Constitutional Setup & Usage
1) Copy `./.qoder/` into your project root
2) Review and customize `rules/constitution.md` for your parliamentary structure
3) Configure democratic roles and consensus scoring matrix
4) Add official sources under `guide/index.md` and project documentation under `docs/`
5) Initialize Memory Bank with constitutional compliance tracking
6) Run parliamentary oversight workflow during Pre/During/Post execution

## Democratic Best Practices
- **Constitutional Supremacy**: Always read Constitution + `guide/` + `docs/` + Memory Bank before any action
- **Parliamentary Process**: Follow Proposal→Opposition Review→Debate→>95% Consensus→Judicial Review→Implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Opposition challenges every proposal with evidence-based alternatives
- **Judicial Review**: Chief Justice validates constitutional compliance for all major decisions
- **MCP Tool Usage**: Parallelize reads/search only; never parallelize writes; maintain constitutional compliance

## Memory Bank with Constitutional Compliance
- `constitution.md` — Supreme law with 11 articles (≤11,500 characters)
- `global_rules.md` — Operational implementation under constitutional authority
- `activeContext.md` — Current focus with constitutional compliance status
- `progress.md` — Milestones with democratic process validation
- `mistakes.md` — Constitutional violations and learning patterns
- `roadmap.md` — Strategic objectives with parliamentary approval
