# AegisIDE Business Model: Democratizing AI Development

## Our Mission

**AegisIDE** makes advanced AI development accessible to everyone, everywhere. We believe that powerful AI tools shouldn't be locked behind expensive subscriptions or corporate barriers.

**Our Vision**: Every developer, regardless of budget or location, should have access to professional-grade AI assistance that remembers, learns, and works autonomously.

**Our Goal**: Transform how software is built by giving teams an AI assistant that works like a professional development team - with memory, standards, and democratic decision-making.
